And what Shannon showed is if the noise in the cable to the people watching this is above a threshold, they're doomed. But if the noise is below a threshold for a linear increase in the energy representing our conversation, the error rate goes down exponentially.\nSpeaker 2: you\nSpeaker 1: Exponentials are fast. There's very few of them in engineering. And the exponential reduction of error below a threshold if you restore state is called a threshold theorem. That's what led to digital. That means unreliable things can work reliably. So Shannon did that for communication. And then von Neumann was inspired by that and applied it to computation. And he showed how an unreliable computer can operate reliably by using the same threshold property\nSpeaker 2: you\nSpeaker 1: of restoring state. It was then forgotten many years. We had to rediscover it in effect in the quantum computing era when things are very unreliable again. But now to go back to how does this relate to the biggest things I've made?

The biggest myth about AI is the one promulgated by Hollywood and the Terminator, that AI is a being, a monster, and that it's out. It's not a being. It's not out to get us. It's a tool.

The good news is if you just give it a different prompt, it can change its bias on a dime.\nSpeaker 1: How important is transparency in AI algorithms?\nSpeaker 2: Transparency is very important, but it's also very hard.

We need to invent new technologies and new science, and AI is fantastic in helping our leading scientists do that.\nSpeaker 1: What are some interesting use cases that you've heard companies try out for better or for worse?\nSpeaker 2: There are so many, for example, regulatory compliance. There's so much difficult and complex compliance information. And guess what? AI is really good at reading through documents and figuring out how to do compliance.

Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Count 1, violation of Internal Revenue Services Act, 1956. Count 2, violation of Federal Tax Rules and Regulations Act, 1989.

1,"Speaker 2: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: They basically, the-, I I'm looking at, um, multi mode lasers.

And. you can. With a pretty simple model you can find that frequency. in a transient, but you can't find that frequency in a driven, uh, frequency.

1,"Speaker 1: So. yeah, that that particular frequency according to most models. damps out very quickly.
