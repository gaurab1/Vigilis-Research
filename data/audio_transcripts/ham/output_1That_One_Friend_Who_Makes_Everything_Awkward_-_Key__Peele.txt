Speaker 2: Best comic book adaptation to film, hands down, no argument. See you later, girls.
Speaker 1: All right. I know I'm in the minority here, but I don't really like the Christopher Nolan Batman movies. I don't. I really just feel like they're overrated. Okay. Well, that's, um, that's just an opinion, you see.
Speaker 2: That's why I prefaced it by saying
