Speaker 2: huh?
Speaker 1: What price?
Speaker 2: uh, free.
Speaker 1: Free !
Speaker 2: which is even better, yes.
Speaker 1: Wow. But what about you?
Speaker 2: xxx uh, then I'll work on me. uh because see if I don't. I, if I don't get back  like next week it's no big deal. I could just stay here. So it's not important for me.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: You see? So the main thing is to get your, your deal.
Speaker 1: So you might not come back here?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: Got you.
Speaker 2: See I'm only be there for like three or four days.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: So I mean if it's going to cost me an arm and a leg it's cheaper if I just stay here.
Speaker 1: Right. So you don't need.
Speaker 2: Because I don't have to do anything but work that day so.
Speaker 1: Right. Well what happens to your work then?
Speaker 2: Well I just won't do it. But I mean if I have to pay you know, a thousand dollars it's not. expeditious to make a thousand and.
Speaker 1: That's a big word. Those crosswords are making you use big words.
Speaker 2: pay a thousand. Is that what it is? Getting better?
Speaker 1: uhhuh.
Speaker 2: xxx mhm hm xxx. That's the purpose.
Speaker 1: uhhuh.
Speaker 2: Increase your word power. So.
Speaker 1: Well.
Speaker 2: you know that would, that would be the. the thing. I mean. there's no way I'm sure you're not going to get back. you know within a day or two of the time. You know because there're eighteen hundred flights that. that go back.
Speaker 1: I'm not on American.
Speaker 2: On American. On American. They go from London.
Speaker 1:  oh this is a flight to London?
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I see.
Speaker 2: Right. And then  just get the  connecting flight.
Speaker 1: Can you get me a connecting flight?
Speaker 2: Well that shouldn't be a problem.
Speaker 1: Susan said there's no inter-Europe flights.
Speaker 2: Right. Right. No, I can go down to the place here and. xxx Sure. Sure. uh  nothing's  uh possible with Susan. No, everybody  who doesn't have a ticket a month ago is not going to fly for the rest of the year.
Speaker 1: So you don't want a ticket to Milan, for nine hundred dollars?
Speaker 2: Well again that's the point. I mean if it's going to cost that. uh It's easier for me just to get yours than. not do one.
Speaker 1: okay.
Speaker 2: You see?
Speaker 1: I'm eating a banana, excuse me.
Speaker 2: It just. I see. You know it just  depends on if you would. just like the. you know stand by that's the.
Speaker 1: Well.
Speaker 2: You know to have a sh- you know.
Speaker 1: And I'd have to stand by in London by myself.
Speaker 2: uhhuh. Like a big girl, yes. Yes  Exactly. but exactly. That's the, that's the thing. You know we just pick a,.
Speaker 1: Amazing.
Speaker 2: just pick a day  you know like probably the Tuesday. like the  first of August. would be the best time.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: um Mondays sometimes people coming back but uh, you know nobody leaves on Tuesdays.
Speaker 1: Well do you think it would be better to come like on that Friday the twenty first and then I'd be closer to the middle of August anyways?
Speaker 2: uh, well I mean that's some-.
Speaker 1: Can we do that?
Speaker 2: mm that's something you could do. uh, you know the other thing is.
Speaker 1: Because if you're not coming anyways then.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: I don't have to fly with you so I could just come that Friday.
Speaker 2: Right. Well, the other thing is is that you could just stay longer. Right. Exactly. Get a short flight. Just stay longer.
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but.
Speaker 2: Maybe you came like the twenty first uh,. It would be uh
Speaker 1: Right. I think I should go back to work but I think it would be better if I came on the twenty first that way then.
Speaker 2: uhhuh.
Speaker 1: If you can change it.
Speaker 2: Well I can probably change it.
Speaker 1: Because that way. I'll be closer to the middle of August and. hopefully if there's, when the problems arise with  David Steel, I'm not going to even say if. um,. I can resolve it from here and not have it ruin my vacation.
Speaker 2: uhhuh. Right. oh that's true.
Speaker 1: You know I'd rather not have to be doing that craziness and I'd still be there for B B King and Etta James. duh, duh, buh@b, buh@b, duh duh.
Speaker 2: They uh, they there?
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: What day are they t-, here?
Speaker 1: Hold on. You don't have the paper.
Speaker 2: Well I no I got it. I g-. uh they're here, they're here the twenty third so yeah you'd get here the twenty second. It is true.
Speaker 1: You know and if they didn't have room on the twenty first I could come the twentieth just a few days, by myself a few days.
Speaker 2: uhhuh. Right. Right. okay. um ,.
Speaker 1: Where was that paper by the way?
Speaker 2: Which paper?
Speaker 1: The paper that.
Speaker 2: I copied it for you and gave it to you.
Speaker 1: No. No. I mean where was it  when you told me I had it and I told you you had it. Who had it?
Speaker 2: I don't know. I don't know.
Speaker 1: Where did it come from?
Speaker 2: It's history  It's history detective.
Speaker 1: Who, where did it come from?
Speaker 2: The important thing is that we have it.
Speaker 1: I want to be able to say I told you so.
Speaker 2: No. No. No. I I No, I know that. I know that. I know that well. That's the most important thing in your life. Yes. No. I know that very well. Yes. You're just not happy to have it. You have to get some,  got to get some justice. I told you dumb shit. No. I, I know the program. It's tough. It's tough. uh, so what I'll do then is  then I'll go ahead and get it then.
Speaker 1: okay. Will you have any money I can stand by?
Speaker 2: I've got.
Speaker 1: Like go get a hotel if I have to? oh I'll have some money by then.
Speaker 2: oh right. uh, no. Right. Everybody will  have the stuff by then. yeah. That won't be a problem. Won't be a problem. The sixteenth you'd have to stay over in Boston anyway. uh if you did that. But again that's not, see I, that one wasn't even available the last time I called.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2:  they said call because people do cancel.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: And   so you know during the time we just call. on a daily basis just.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 2: changing.
Speaker 1: That's groovy.
Speaker 2: But  it's not a problem.
Speaker 1: I'm excited.
Speaker 2: The only problem will be the ticket to get to London. But I'll  see if we can get a one way. and then buy another one way going back.
Speaker 1: Where's this ticket, this ticket is to Milan?
Speaker 2: uh no get it to Nice, from London to Nice.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: Right.
Speaker 1: No. I mean coming, when I leave L A the where do I fly to? London?
Speaker 2: London. mhm yeah.
Speaker 1:  And then I'll have to  take a boat because there's no, no inter-Europe's according to Susan.
Speaker 2: ah. Right. Exactly. All the people in Europe are paralyzed. yep. No. It's, it's great.
Speaker 1: Well let me know.
Speaker 2: uh no. I'll go ahead and  do it.

Speaker 1: okay.
Speaker 2: It's really good restaurant. They were people who went to the jazz festival with me last year. They own the restaurant.

Speaker 1: That's fine.
Speaker 2: Nice people.
Speaker 1: Cool.
Speaker 2: Cool.
Speaker 1: Cool.
Speaker 2: Cool yes yes. So have any of your things closed?

Speaker 1: Nothing. I just had a nice dream though that David. is was just fine.
Speaker 2: uhhuh.
Speaker 1: That he got his money in today like he's supposed to.
Speaker 2: Right. That was a dream. So he still hasn't made any inroads?
Speaker 1: uh uh.
Speaker 2: Nothing huh?
Speaker 1: He's having trouble closing his station.
Speaker 2: uhhuh. It may not happen.
Speaker 1:  oh god.

Speaker 1: The station?
Speaker 2: Right. If he doesn't get the station.
Speaker 1: Probably.
Speaker 2: He'll commit suicide.
Speaker 1: He'll be in bad shape. and then that's because everybody involved will get sued.
Speaker 2: What do you mean? Everybody involved? Does that mean Shirl Clay?
Speaker 1: Probably.
Speaker 2: Why?
Speaker 1: I don't think they can but I think they'll try. You know how people are.
