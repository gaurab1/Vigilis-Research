Speaker 2: you're not gonna hang up on me. are you. no. okay. all right. I'm gonna hit the one now. okay. I think we're - we're gonna be recorded and publicly distributed.
Speaker 1: educational purposes. and maybe distributed.
Speaker 2: all right. knock. knock. alright. you're wasting precious minutes here.
Speaker 1: wasting precious minutes. so how long do we get. half.
Speaker 2: hour.
Speaker 1: get a half an hour. oh my god. I'll be lucky if I could stay awake that long.
Speaker 2: you tired what.
Speaker 1: yeah.
Speaker 2: yeah. so what have you guys been doing.
Speaker 1: what have we been doing. we've been hanging out with Steven.
Speaker 2: ah. mom and dad  have fun with him.
Speaker 1: yeah. yeah. they  they left today. we go back but.
Speaker 2: so what's the little guy up to.
Speaker 1: let's see. he's like sleeping. and.
Speaker 2: he's working the computer now isn't he.
Speaker 1: not quite. he smiles now.
Speaker 2: wow. that's close enough.
Speaker 1: no. yeah. I mean not constantly but he does.
Speaker 2: I'd be worried if he did constantly.
Speaker 1: what else does he do. he - he stares at the clock. he makes noises.
Speaker 2: does he play with anything.
Speaker 1: not - not really.
Speaker 2: yeah. can he move his hands.
Speaker 1: around. oh well yeah.
Speaker 2: he'll <I mean> - I mean like does he know what he's doing or is he just kind of flailing.
Speaker 1: well he stretches. that's pretty cool.
Speaker 2: that's.
Speaker 1: pretty - pretty cool. like he sticks his arms up over his head. and he stretches his legs out fully extends. so that's pretty neat when he does that.
Speaker 2: I can hear him in the background. can you. yeah. what time does he go to bed.
Speaker 1: whenever he feels like it. what time does he go to bed. he - he sleeps intermittently. and then who then if we're lucky he goes to sleep around ten or eleven. oh that's cool. and then wakes up to  eat during the night.
Speaker 2: so he gained any weight.
Speaker 1: oh yeah. yeah. he's how much do you think he weighs now then probably about ten pounds.
Speaker 2: yeah. so he is growing fast. yeah.
Speaker 1: he's probably about ten. he's four weeks old today.
Speaker 2: wow.
Speaker 1: yeah. so he has another actual. we'll find out exactly what he weighs on. Monday.
Speaker 2: oh he's got another appointment.
Speaker 1: another appointment then which is pretty cool. but I can't go to that one unfortunately.
Speaker 2: you gotta work. yeah. you working Saturdays now. still. yeah. ooh. that's not fun. yep. what time do you have to be in.
Speaker 1: seven. ooh. so I'm tired.
Speaker 2: what.
Speaker 1: I said. that's one of the reasons I'm tired.
Speaker 2: yeah. what time do you get up to - to go six.
Speaker 1: like. well I guess I may get up a little bit earlier with him because I'll get up and change him and everything. so around five thirty.
Speaker 2: ooh.
Speaker 1: yeah.
Speaker 2: how long commute is it to work.
Speaker 1:  it's not long. it's only like fifteen or twenty minutes. yeah. so that's for me to drive to work. that's not that bad but  what else new and exciting with me. you kind I kind of caught me in a half - half days state.
Speaker 2: well you can give the phone over to Dino when you're done. no.
Speaker 1: but my eyes are getting pretty heavy.
Speaker 2: I want my half hour's worth out of this call.
Speaker 1: okay. I'll try my best.
Speaker 2: Job kidding. arts fest is on.
Speaker 1: oh my god. it's arts fest right now. well how come you're not out drinking.
Speaker 2: how come I'm not drinking. yeah. well I was supposed to get paid  last week or whatever or what I thought. yeah. and something happened where they're like. because they had stopped pay paying me for a while. so I have to wait two weeks. so I went to take some money outta my mac on like Wednesday mhm. and it's said. insufficient funds. I'm like. what the hell is happening. I should have like six hundred fifty bucks in there. so I call up. and they're like. well you won't be paid until now this Monday but next Monday yeah like won't be in your account. so then I called my parents today or yesterday and asked them if they could send me some money like two hundred dollars a hundred dollars to keep the mac open and a hundred dollars for groceries and other stuff for the next week and a half. yeah. and then I'd give them a check in - in like two weeks for the two hundred. but  it ended up that  it didn't go through or something. because I tried to use the mac tonight.
Speaker 1: so basically you're broke.
Speaker 2: basically <I have> - I have whatever loose change I have.
Speaker 1: that's worse than me.
Speaker 2: yeah. I couldn't even do laundry because I don't have quarters. and I have no money to get to take a ten dollars bill out and get changed.
Speaker 1: it's pretty sad. John.
Speaker 2: yeah it is. well I'm kind of angry about that. but yeah.
Speaker 1: that's why you're doing this free phone call thing. huh.
Speaker 2: well there you go. now. well I it's technically - technically I have the money. it's just I can't touch it. yeah. so  we'll - we'll fix that at the next pay period I guess. but.
Speaker 1: yeah. I just got paid today.
Speaker 2: yeah. I always spent three and a half hours yesterday. walking around. art Fest.
Speaker 1: did.
Speaker 2: you. yeah. my  my friend Rebecca was teaching me Spanish I was learning Spanish words for things while we were going around.
Speaker 1: oh man. I'm so jealous.
Speaker 2: it was like ninety. oh it was what's the temperature down there.
Speaker 1: it's like. really damn hot.
Speaker 2: yeah. we're - we're like in the nineties up here. so we were out looking at arts Fest at like four o'clock. yeah. until like seven  thirty or something like that yesterday. and like talk about how I mean everybody was sweating out there.
Speaker 1: that's what people tend to do. and it's really hot. John yeah.
Speaker 2: well it's kind of weird. because we've been having stuff like - like - like really I didn't need to use my air conditioner really in my room. like most of this summer. and it's like all of a sudden we have this huge jump up into the nineties.
Speaker 1: yes. yeah - yeah.
Speaker 2: was it sudden for you guys or was it just.
Speaker 1: no. it's like that all the time. yeah.
Speaker 2: well you got your pool every day. you got your pool.
Speaker 1: yeah. I never get to go in it though.
Speaker 2: has little Steven been in it.
Speaker 1: no. we've heard probably by the end of summer. we'll get them in get it. uhhuh.
Speaker 2: I heard you can teach kids to swim. babies to swim.
Speaker 1: yeah. actually I think d I had a book outta the library on that. but I don't know if  I - I have to get it out again. try it out.
Speaker 2: how you know what else I heard. what with little guys. I hear. Finley yeah.
Speaker 1: he's being a pain in the ass.
Speaker 2: I heard that  they can develop that like that. perfect pitch or whatever when they're young.
Speaker 1: perfect. what.
Speaker 2: pitch like pitch. yeah. perfect. pitch like  like baseball. no. like music. so like if you like get like one of those little toys or something that plays a scale or something like that. every once in a while play that or just at least play music. they can develop a real good year.
Speaker 1: yeah. I crank up the music in the car.
Speaker 2: you playing the Mozart for him.
Speaker 1: I'm playing rock and roll.
Speaker 2: geez. the kid's gonna come out with brain damage.
Speaker 1: no - no I'm not playing it that loud. plus he - he can sleep through anything. I tell you that he slept through the July fourth fireworks at the beach.
Speaker 2: oh geez.
Speaker 1: I mean the entire thing. half an hour. wow. grand finale. and all slept through it. didn't flinch.
Speaker 2: were your parents down there on the fourth.
Speaker 1: yeah. yeah. yeah. they were down here for close to two weeks.
Speaker 2: did they stay with you for the whole two weeks. yeah. oh I thought they were staying over some other relatives.
Speaker 1: no.
Speaker 2: yeah. my mom got the story wrong.
Speaker 1: no. well no. they went away for like two days to Tampa to my aunt and uncle's house. uhhuh. but other than that they were.
Speaker 2: here they must have been pretty excited with the little guy.
Speaker 1: yeah. yeah. they thought he was pretty cool.
Speaker 2: did you guys get a chance to go out and use them as babysitters. or.
Speaker 1: no not really because Dina's breastfeeding. so we couldn't do that. we're at the mercy of his feeding schedule. so not much we could do really right now. no. he is on a bottle.
Speaker 2: so how long until he starts crawling.
Speaker 1: couple months. yeah. he'll be a month old on Sunday.
Speaker 2: hey.
Speaker 1: yeah.
Speaker 2: it was it June sixteenth. right. yeah.
Speaker 1: yeah.
Speaker 2: man. he's progressing. yes.
Speaker 1: he is that's good.
Speaker 2: to hear.
Speaker 1: tell me what's been going on in State College.
Speaker 2:  let's.
Speaker 1: I'm so jealous. I wanna be at Arts Fest.
Speaker 2:  I didn't know the year we were up here. I didn't know. they had bands playing constantly at the main  old Main.
Speaker 1: what kind of bands.
Speaker 2:  different stuff all - all different stuff. it's just like all day there's bands and stuff there. it seems like there's more - more of those little  booths. because. now they stretch like they go up Allen yeah. and then they - they curve around like a horseshoe. and go back down by that post office.
Speaker 1: yeah.
Speaker 2: and then they - they have stuff that goes all the way from the  the - the road that the panther's on.
Speaker 1: the - the panther.
Speaker 2: a lion. whatever. what the hell. are you talking about. John the - the road's the lions on it. goes from the bottom of that all the way up and around  you know Willard and then onto the mall.
Speaker 1: yeah.
Speaker 2: has it always been that money.
Speaker 1: <I think> - I think so.
Speaker 2: I don't remember it being all the way on Pollock like that before.
Speaker 1: I don't know.
Speaker 2: but.
Speaker 1: yeah. yeah. it went all the way down.
Speaker 2: oh I don't remember. road. I don't remember looking at that many things <when I> - when I was up there. but  yeah it.
Speaker 1: was big. a couple years.
Speaker 2: ago. so <it's kinda> - it's kinda nice. I mean it's really crowded here in town now. yeah. because everybody it seems like everybody's up. but. oh man.
Speaker 1: probably like.
Speaker 2: nobody I really know is up like. yeah.
Speaker 1: but probably a lot of people I know are there.
Speaker 2: oh sure.
Speaker 1: probably only fraternity brothers are up there. I haven't seen for two years.
Speaker 2: well you can go another decade without seeing them.
Speaker 1: hey when we  when we come up for Thanksgiving the week before Thanksgiving uhhuh. probably what we'll do. do you know what your plans are like. well you I guess you don't know really.
Speaker 2: oh I'm getting a car.
Speaker 1: you are.
Speaker 2: yeah. what little Barron oh yeah. I thought that. oh you heard about that. geez. I didn't even know that. but you probably knew before I did.
Speaker 1: yeah. long before I wasn't allowed to tell you.
Speaker 2: I wish they I wish somebody would've because my dad like told me like the weekend that I could have gone home with Bogger and gotten it because he is not going home like. I why did he.
Speaker 1: tell you then.
Speaker 2:  he told me last Saturday yeah. and Dave left you know Friday to go home. oh so then I called Dave up this weekend. I'm like. Dave when are you going home again. he is like. well he is not going home this weekend for arts fest. yeah. he is not going home next weekend. and  so it's like you know like I - I if I get a car can be like by like the thirtieth of July or something.
Speaker 1: your dad should come up and pick you up and bring you home. and then you can drive the car.
Speaker 2: back. I wouldn't wanna put that much extra miles on my car. I think he's got like a hundred fifty or a hundred sixty or something as it is a hundred.
Speaker 1: and sixty thousand miles. yeah.
Speaker 2: really I think so. wow. but  so <I'm gonna> - I'm gonna ask and see if Diane  wants to come  home for the weekend. yeah with me because  our friend well her - her future roommate too Lynn is lives like by me. I I'll just ask because also she Diane Diane's in Miami now. Miami yeah. she grew up around Miami then she moved to Canada yeah. and  that's quite.
Speaker 1: a difference.
Speaker 2: yeah. so now she's like living in State College so it's kinda like. I don't know if she's been to Philadelphia or like actually been around this. so I'm like if she wants to go home I could say. like. oh we can go hang out around Philadelphia we can hang out with Lynn and her boyfriend and stuff like that. and then we can just come home after the next day. and I can get my car. so my other option is Dave and his parents came up for this weekend. yeah. but they're not going home until like Monday or Tuesday or something. and  man.
Speaker 1: your parents up for arts fest.
Speaker 2: what.
Speaker 1: his parents are up for arts.
Speaker 2: fest. his parents both met at Penn State oh man. and  they married and all that. so and then his brother went to Penn State yeah. so they're like they can they - they ca. when Dave told me when he was little they came up to Penn State every home football game.
Speaker 1: every one.
Speaker 2: really and stayed the whole weekend. wow. and his parents come up I think for everything. his dad still comes up just for the football games now. yeah. like every time there's a home one. I don't understand that.
Speaker 1: oh I miss Penn State.
Speaker 2: well guess what coming soon you can see Kaja on tv. I know that's gonna be exciting. I just read an article today. maybe I'll send you some of this stuff. I you know I got some papers and stuff. I'll send you. I'll send you an arts fest thing too. yeah. just to see what's going on. oh that'd be good. but  like they said that  Cincinnati's gonna adjust its whole offense for Kaja Carter.
Speaker 1: that'd be cool.
Speaker 2: so that's gonna be pretty interesting. and now he's got.
Speaker 1: he'll be playing the Jags this year too.
Speaker 2: yeah. yeah. Pittsburgh's gonna be playing them too. that'll be a big deal. and  you know they have an exhibition game. the end of this month. yes.
Speaker 1: I know that against Carolina yeah.
Speaker 2: I hope I get that one that better be broadcast everywhere.
Speaker 1: I think it is.
Speaker 2: that'd be cool. because now I got the since I got Lynn's tv I got cable. ah. so I can check that out.
Speaker 1: very good.
Speaker 2: what other things can I tell you. oh I bought a mechanical engineering book.
Speaker 1: oh that's exciting.
Speaker 2: I feel you'd be proud of me because you probably have it.
Speaker 1: no. I probably sold it for pure money at the end of the semester.
Speaker 2: now I got this one because it's got everything in it that I need for structural engineering. what - what is it. it's like for your Emec oh five one or something. mechanical design.
Speaker 1: I think I did sell that. yeah.
Speaker 2: but it's got the - the reason I - I bought it was because it's got strength and materials. it's got more circle and engineering mechanics in it. ah. and a bunch of other stuff like I need all in one book.
Speaker 1: basically a bunch of crap that you never use.
Speaker 2:  I use it.
Speaker 1: you use it. yeah.
Speaker 2: I use some interesting stuff in my work.
Speaker 1: yes.
Speaker 2: but  yeah I've been spending all week  trying to figure out about fiber bond adhesion with steel fibers. the concrete. ooh. so that was kinda exciting for my thesis. so.
Speaker 1: hey. if you look up exciting in the dictionary. that's what it says.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you.
Speaker 1: steel fives. being bound to concrete. what more could you possibly want.
Speaker 2: you know what else is exciting that goes on during arts fest that you remember up here. besides just everybody being up here I guess. because not everybody I know is up here.
Speaker 1: it's just everyone being up there. basically. no.
Speaker 2: I was gonna say.
Speaker 1: because it's a big party. because everyone's back because.
Speaker 2: it's Mocho expensive here.
Speaker 1: everything prices jacked up for everything.
Speaker 2: or what. well what I saw you know like you know just buying a gift or something. like even just a coffee mug or something. yeah. the minimum price this year seems to be twenty bucks.
Speaker 1: oh my god.
Speaker 2: you know like - like  where Rebecca was.
Speaker 1: at Booth you mean.
Speaker 2: yeah. Rebecca was looking at some stuff that she wants to get gifts for her brothers and sisters. not.
Speaker 1: sister the booths. booth@k anyway. sorry.
Speaker 2: Rebecca's family's coming up from Venezuela at the end of the month that she wanted to get them all like gifts and stuff. yeah. so we're like looking around. and like she found like one thing I thought it was kind of ugly. it was like some like little pottery thing of a little face. but it was like ten - ten or fifteen bucks. but the average thing I was seeing like just even just like a coffee mug or even pictures were like twenty bucks like little pictures. yeah it didn't even look that good. but I saw a picture I really loved. yeah a hundred ninety.
Speaker 1:  <that would be> - that would be so cool. if we could if we were up there and could get something for our house for.
Speaker 2: yeah I know - know art fest. hey you want me to pick you out something you can. I'm kidding. there's not  the theme this year seems to be.
Speaker 1: like a picture or.
Speaker 2: something. the theme this year seems to be booze with just - just pictures. yeah. as Rebecca said. <bad clothing> - bad clothing. and   lots of glasses and dishes. and what was the other theme. I think that - that was those are pretty much the major themes. like just about like. oh and jewelry.
Speaker 1: jewelry. yes.
Speaker 2: but I mean this is like regular. this looked like a lot of the jewelry. looked like mall jewelry. it wasn't the cool stuff. like  I mean not mal you know what I mean like you know you see like a ring. it's just a piece of metal like you know it's just silver. there's nothing that fancy about it. yeah. like I used to like looking at the things  like the intricate like made by like an artist you know where they put things together. and they make little shapes. so they have etchings in it and stuff and really intricate work. yeah. but a lot of this stuff is just plain like you know like a ring with a rock in it.
Speaker 1: yeah.
Speaker 2: you know something like that. I don't think that's that exciting because I - I - I like to see some of the - the. I mean they got some really interesting art things in some spots up here.
Speaker 1: how's your woman. John.
Speaker 2:  any anything. don't ask.
Speaker 1: don't ask.
Speaker 2: I got   she has a like  I - I was you know I was writing her like every week. yeah. and  calling. so I just figured I'd see you know what would happen if I didn't write her call. well it's been over two weeks. and I haven't I have not heard from her either by phone or by mail.
Speaker 1: maybe she's sitting there saying. wow. John doesn't carry stuff. writing.
Speaker 2: well see I don't understand why - why I'm always perceived as not caring by my girl girlfriends when I like constantly send letters and never forget the call. but if they don't.
Speaker 1: that's because most people aren't as persistent as you are with writing and calling and all that.
Speaker 2: yeah. I don't know. <I just> - I just don't feel like  writing all these letters and just having her like when she comes you know she's not writing back or whatever. I just don't feel like seeing her. the first day she comes back moving in with her - her boyfriend helping her move this stuff back in. yeah. so. well new topic.
Speaker 1: new topic. enough of that. even has a girlfriend.
Speaker 2: does he. yeah who.
Speaker 1: her name's Maria she lives across the street.
Speaker 2: ah. how old is Maria four.
Speaker 1: days old.
Speaker 2: ooh. is she cute. is she a looker. yeah.
Speaker 1: she has lots of hair. lots of.
Speaker 2: oh there you go. dark.
Speaker 1: hair. yeah. so they were introduced for the first time yesterday.
Speaker 2: oh so I guess  Maria was sleeping a lot.
Speaker 1: yes. so was Steven actually.
Speaker 2: really well I heard they.
Speaker 1: probably kinda like just laying there with a.
Speaker 2: most people it say. well it's like six to eight weeks before they really started that's.
Speaker 1: right. he was awake.
Speaker 2: started to get interactive. how long like six to eight weeks before they really started to get interactive.
Speaker 1: Steven's interactive. yeah.
Speaker 2: he's multimedia. sorry.
Speaker 1: he's staring at the ceiling. what - what does that mean. John.
Speaker 2: no. it's like when you say interactive. I was thinking the computer terminology. you know. it's like the big marketing scheme. now is it's interactive.
Speaker 1: yes it's.
Speaker 2: interactive. get yourself a kid. it's interactive.
Speaker 1: yeah. well he stares at the ceiling fan. and.
Speaker 2: do you read to them or anything. yeah. that's good. yes. yeah. that's how they - they learn a lot of their  they develop a lot of their skills.
Speaker 1: does bad at toys. we lay him down. he has a little activity thing.
Speaker 2: did you give him the - the bear yet.
Speaker 1: yeah.
Speaker 2: yeah. what does he think of it.
Speaker 1:  I don't it doesn't really do much with.
Speaker 2: he drools on it. right. no.
Speaker 1: no. what Dean wants to know. if you think he talks and walks by now.
Speaker 2: I thought he'd be driving by now.
Speaker 1: driving.
Speaker 2: yeah.
Speaker 1: hmm. no. he said but.
Speaker 2: he was using the phone last week.
Speaker 1: Steven's gonna be what.
Speaker 2:  well he was using the phone last week. I mean I got a message from him. that's.
Speaker 1: right. that's right.
Speaker 2: yeah. he's got some I mean the kids mastered the English language.
Speaker 1: I know he just  uses it selectively. hey Dana do you wanna talk to John for the recorded call. so who's listening to this.
Speaker 2:  probably some sort of. I don't know. I think they only take bits and pieces of it or something. it's.
Speaker 1: been a pretty boring conversation so far. well.
Speaker 2: maybe then there's hope they won't use it for anything.
Speaker 1: yeah. Dean will do phone sex with.
