Speaker 2: what is the difference between a Sunfish and a sail- what is a Sunfish.
Speaker 1: it's a little sailboat. really scrawny one.
Speaker 2: how many people fit.
Speaker 1: about one and a half. one person can sit comfortably the other person can be. scrunched up and then if you want you can stuff a third person in. which we did.
Speaker 2: ooh.
Speaker 1: and she sits like on the wrong side. with the boat leans over they just fall out. and well it has. and. big boats you know they usually have two sails or more.
Speaker 2: yeah.
Speaker 1: well a Sunfish is. it's really small and it has one sail. and it's really light. um I mean the sail was big. in proportion to the little tiny rest of the boat.
Speaker 2: yeah.
Speaker 1: so it goes really fast it's like. and that. and you know it can only carry two or three people as I told you. and it's it's fun.
Speaker 2: so which do you like better.
