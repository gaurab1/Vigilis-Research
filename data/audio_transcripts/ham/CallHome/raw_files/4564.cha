Speaker 2:	So, how are you? 
Speaker 1:	I'm fine.
Speaker 1:	I'm very fine.
Speaker 1:	How are you?
Speaker 1:	I haven't talked to you in a long time.
Speaker 1:	I feel like I've ta- I talk to David almost every day. 
Speaker 2:	yeah. 
Speaker 2:	Isn't that wild?
Speaker 1:	I don't know what it there's really no difference between between writing a letter and and the way we correspond.
Speaker 1:	As a matter of fact, what I do is I sit down and write a letter at my own leisure, you know, at. 
Speaker 1:	at the word processor and then late at night I send it over, you know the online, ov- on email +/. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	+, and there's really no reason why we couldn't have written letters like this all these years and put them in the mailbox. 
Speaker 2:	Well, you know what I don't. 
Speaker 1:	I don't know - there's something about this that's easier, I don't know how to d- explain it.
Speaker 2:	That you find the email is easier? 
Speaker 1:	yeah, it's this I guess that it's no different except that you don't have to go out and get stamps and put it in the mailbox. 
Speaker 2:	I think also that you know that someone's going to be reading it the next day, not possibly in a week.
Speaker 2:	You know that you know that what you're saying is going to be heard. 
Speaker 2:	Sometimes when you write a letter you figure eventually they're going to get this and it's already going to be old news and you know this it's more of a communica- you feel like you're really communicating with email. 
Speaker 1:	yeah. 
Speaker 1:	Kind of, even though it's eh even though there is a delay.
Speaker 1:	But it I don't know, it's like cute. 
Speaker 1:	Also I get a - I get a kick out of pressing all those buttons and everything . 
Speaker 2:	So tell me.
Speaker 2:	okay, first what you have to start off tell me about all your kids.
Speaker 2:	Start at the beginning. 
Speaker 1:	Or should I - I'll start at the end. 
Speaker 2:	okay. 
Speaker 1:	Avi is very cute. 
Speaker 2:	yeah. 
Speaker 1:	He's he's like, um, he's nine months old already. 
Speaker 2:	oh, my god. 
Speaker 1:	Believe it or not. 
Speaker 2:	What's he doing?
Speaker 2:	Tell me every-
Speaker 1:	He's not really like. 
Speaker 1:	He's only like seven months old. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	But the truth is, like all my children, he's really only like five months old. 
Speaker 2:	I. 
Speaker 1:	He's a lump on a log. 
Speaker 2:	I would be surprised. 
Speaker 1:	He's very alert, he's very alert and and very responsive and laughs and eats well. 
Speaker 1:	Hello? 
Speaker 2:	No, I'm here, I just don't want to interrupt because I hate that echo thing.
Speaker 2:	okay. 
Speaker 1:	okay. 
Speaker 1:	ah, and -uh but he doesn't move. 
Speaker 2:	okay, well that's normal, you're not worried about that. 
Speaker 1:	xxx - 
Speaker 2:	That's all your kids. 
Speaker 1:	No but you know because because he was premature, he's getting a lot of attention. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	So we go ph- to physical therapy once a week, and the truth is what I'm learning about it oh because I spend so much time with the  physical therapist is that all my kids could have used  physical therapy in this case -.
Speaker 1:	 The truth is we could all use physical therapy because it would all make us more balanced people between the right and our left hemispheres and something about. 
Speaker 1:	being organized internally gets you organized ext- I I've learned a_lot.
Speaker 1:	I don't know half of it is probably baloney, but. 
Speaker 1:	if any of it's true they all needed physical therapy  At a very young age. 
Speaker 2:	oh god.
Speaker 2:	How often do you have to take him? 
Speaker 1:	No because they don't like to ~pl. 
Speaker 2:	How often do you take him? 
Speaker 1:	I take him once a week. 
Speaker 2:	I'm sorry, what? 
Speaker 1:	Once a week.
Speaker 1:	Once a week. 
Speaker 2:	okay. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 1:	um and, -uh he doesn't like to play on his stomach, he only likes to be on his back. 
Speaker 2:	Right . 
Speaker 1:	So as soon as you put him on it, he can he can lift his head and everything and and now he's starting to extend his hands out even. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	But he just xxx as soon as he gets that toy, he just rolls over to play with it on his back. 
Speaker 2:	oh. 
Speaker 1:	So uh.
Speaker 1:	No, but they -uh they were all like that, every o- every one of them. 
Speaker 2:	So you don't think it personally it has anything to do with him being premature? 
Speaker 1:	Personally, no. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 1:	No. 
Speaker 2:	But it doesn't hurt. 
Speaker 1:	But I see.
Speaker 1:	Right, but I see that the he- no but it's helping. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 1:	It's helping him be more, he's advancing better, I think. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	Who knows? 
Speaker 2:	And physically he's feeling good? 
Speaker 1:	don't [?] know.
Speaker 1:	We'll find out.

Speaker 2:	hm. 
Speaker 1:	and these eh you know but it wasn't no i- i- at home, nothing serious,
Speaker 2:	Right.
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	but -uh but eh because it's us- those things usually return and it usually is a condition.
Speaker 1:	You know, they prepared me for that and said oh xxx you know, but because millions of kids here have it. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	a_lot_of kids and a_lot_of Hagim a_lot_of -uh preemi- preemies get it. 
Speaker 2:	hm.

Speaker 2:	And how does how did the. 
Speaker 1:	They said xxx -. 
Speaker 2:	Well, wait.

Speaker 2:	=lipsmack I know. 
Speaker 1:	Jochanan liked him Jochanan liked him pretty much right away.
Speaker 1:	Everyone you know they invested so much in him, too.
Speaker 1:	At the beginning we didn't have any of the,. 
Speaker 1:	um, it was as if there was a novelty, because they waited so long to bring him home. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	And then you know the novelty's worn off, which is good. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	It wore off a long time ago.

Speaker 1:	when we  When I remember when I was I was up it was right a couple before a few weeks before we brought him home we cleaned out the room to switch and I said you know I said, we can't put we couldn't put any baby in this room. 
Speaker 1:	Poor Noam got him back. 
Speaker 1:	and Jochanan you know you can mish- you can control it better.

Speaker 2:	Yes. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 1:	um, which I enjoy, but it's not enou- =lips:smack I don't think I have the mindset to to be -um independent.
Speaker 1:	I think I need to be an employee. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 1:	I think it's more it's more suitable to my personality and to it's my it's my personality professional personal- professionally as well as financially. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 1:	I just think the way I manage money, the way we manage money, it's just better. 
Speaker 2:	you like. 
Speaker 2:	You like getting that paycheck once a week and not just waiting for the end of a project or something. 
Speaker 1:	It's. 
Speaker 1:	Right.
Speaker 1:	And I and I don't I enjoy the flexibility of working at home and working when I want, things like that but I don't enjoy the pressure of it.
Speaker 1:	Like you can. 
Speaker 2:	It's always hanging over your head. 
Speaker 1:	Right.
Speaker 1:	With i- and and and I have no problem you know, ignoring the laundry. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	+, and ignoring the kids and working, I just, I just don't like, it's just not it's just not suitable to me.
Speaker 1:	I mean, I do it. 
Speaker 2:	I did it for a short I did it for a while and I hated it also.
Speaker 2:	I absolutely That was one of my kids, I think.
Speaker 2:	I absolutely hated it because it like I would be in the middle of like changing a kid's diaper and the phone would ring and it would you know be a business thing and. 
Speaker 1:	- Could be a client, yeah. 
Speaker 2:	Right right and you're like you have to try to act mature, your kids are screaming in the other room and you like have to pretend that nothing's go- you know and you really want to be in the other room, settling what's going on but you have to drop everything whenever, you never know.
Speaker 2:	It's like there is a bomb waiting to go off always.
Speaker 2:	But you can never relax. 
Speaker 1:	Right and I'd I'd rather not - be in the other room.
Speaker 1:	I'd rather just be on the phone with the client.
Speaker 1:	. 
Speaker 2:	Right But you know you also can never relax, because as soon as you sit down to read a book or do anything you're thinking, well, I really could should be doing this or you know whatever. 
Speaker 1:	Well I don't have that problem, because I don't have the steady I don't have a steady flow of work, either. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 1:	It comes and it goes and it's not th- I don't have that many I don't have that many things and I have to wait for people to refer them and I have to go get them and -uh. 
Speaker 1:	I don't and I and I and as much as as many times as I go over every decision that I made along the way e- even over the last three years, and every decision was the right decision at the right time.
Speaker 1:	I mean, it wasn't anything I did,. 
Speaker 1:	you know I =lipsmack I mean, we had this great master plan. 
Speaker 2:	mm. 
Speaker 1:	a few years ago that I when I was wor- when I was working at the consulting company and doing freelance projects at n- at night. 
Speaker 1:	and going a little crazy because I really didn't have the free- with three kids at home and commuting an -uh three hours a day really it was hard, but I didn't want to give it up because it wasn't so much the money it was I was I was trying to see if this was something I could really do. 
Speaker 1:	If I liked it and if I was good at it. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	And then and when we wanted to have another baby. 
Speaker 1:	And and we figured oh you know and Phil wanted to work more.
Speaker 1:	He wanted to invest more in in his -um in in in his career. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	So, we figured our plan, w- our very, you know, w- all the best laid plans, right? 
Speaker 1:	The truth is our plans came better than they could've.
Speaker 1:	They would have if if our plan was to we wanted to have another baby and then I would have a a -um what's it called, a maternity leave, that I would take an extended one because I had been at this job for a while. 
Speaker 2:	Right. 
Speaker 1:	And then and that's when I would try to freelance a little bit and see and and feel my oats in this but I would have a job waiting for me if I didn't like it.
