Speaker 1:	I just got back from the gym
Speaker 2:	oh good
Speaker 1:	uhhuh
Speaker 2:	How's it going? 
Speaker 1:	oh pretty well.
Speaker 1:	It was really crowded today. 
Speaker 2:	yeah. 
Speaker 1:	I kind_of assumed everyone would be at the shore. 
Speaker 2:	uhhuh. 
Speaker 1:	I was wrong. 
Speaker 2:	Well it's the middle of the week or whatever so. 
Speaker 1:	But it's the fourth of July. 
Speaker 2:	mm. 
Speaker 1:	So. 
Speaker 2:	yeah.
Speaker 2:	People have to work tomorrow. 
Speaker 2:	Do you have to work tomorrow? 
Speaker 1:	yeah. 
Speaker 2:	Did you have off yesterday? 
Speaker 1:	Yes. 
Speaker 2:	oh that's good. 
Speaker 1:	And I was paid too. 
Speaker 2:	oh.
Speaker 2:	Is it paid today? 
Speaker 1:	No. 
Speaker 2:	oh. 
Speaker 1:	But uh. 
Speaker 1:	yeah, so the gym's going well. 
Speaker 2:	oh. 
Speaker 1:	But I still need to go more often. 
Speaker 2:	Well how often are you going? 
Speaker 1:	Only four days a week. 
Speaker 2:	xxx. 
Speaker 1:	yeah.
Speaker 1:	Got to get that up to five. 
Speaker 2:	mm:. 
Speaker 1:	But, I don't really like going with Anne Marie because she doesn't like to stay very long. 
Speaker 2:	Why? 
Speaker 1:	I don't know.
Speaker 1:	She kind of, well unfortunately for some reason she's not like into cardio vascular. 
Speaker 1:	So when I'm still riding the bike she's completely finished her weight lifting routine. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 1:	And like I haven't even started mine. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 1:	You know and I kind of hinted to her that really the only way to lose weight is cardio vascular. 
Speaker 2:	mhm.
Speaker 2:	It's true. 
Speaker 1:	And that lifting the weights won't lose weight. 
Speaker 2:	mm mm. 
Speaker 1:	You won't lose it, you know, but. 
Speaker 2:	No I mean you might lose some but that's only when yo- .
Speaker 2:	For a woman who is lifting not that much I don't think. 
Speaker 1:	yeah. 
Speaker 2:	You would.
Speaker 2:	I mean yeah I mean the only thing is um just getting your heart rate up for extended periods of time. 
Speaker 1:	yeah, So I don't know maybe she'll catch on soon. 
Speaker 2:	You do burn a_lot_of calories an hour though, lifting weights. 
Speaker 1:	uhhuh. 
Speaker 2:	But uh yeah I mean you're not going to, I don't think you're going to lose that much. 
Speaker 1:	n-, and also lifting weights at Bally's means you're standing on line as for as much time as you're actually lifting. 
Speaker 2:	Really. 
Speaker 1:	yeah. 
Speaker 2:	That's too bad. 
Speaker 1:	yeah. 
Speaker 2:	So it's is it really overcrowded? 
Speaker 1:	Well, I mean obviously since I work I can't get there until about six o'clock at night which is when everyone else gets there. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 1:	But I me- I'm sure for people who go in the daytime it's probably dead. 
Speaker 2:	yeah. 
Speaker 1:	You know and I go um, like when I go Saturday and Sunday mornings it's totally dead. 
Speaker 2:	mhm. 
Speaker 1:	So. 
Speaker 1:	But you know. 
Speaker 1:	the weeknights is pretty crazy. 
Speaker 2:	yeah.

Speaker 1:	uhhuh. 
Speaker 2:	 I think um tonight Charlie and I are going to go over and join up .
