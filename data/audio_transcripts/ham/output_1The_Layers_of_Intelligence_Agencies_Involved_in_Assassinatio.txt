Speaker 1: You know that David Icke stuff where he said they're all lizard people? I don't think they're really lizard people. I don't think they're really shapeshifters, but they do behave in a reptilian way, like
Speaker 2: a corporation does, like a psychopath.
Speaker 1: I don't know if they're actual reptilians, dude, but there is something going on that they are a group of people, because they're all related, which is very weird if you go back far enough, they're all related. If you study Obama and Bush, right, because I remember when Obama was running, I was like, oh, change. It's going to be change. Hope and change. Hope and change. And then you start studying the Bushes and the Obamas, and their first ancestor, their common ancestor is a Hinckley, dude, right? And you go- John Hinckley, the guy who tried to kill Reagan? 100%.
Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Yes. Their common ancestor is a Hinckley, and then when you realize that- Hinckley was related to Obama and Bush? They're related to the Bushes. The Bushes had dinner with the Hinckleys the night before Reagan got shot.
Speaker 2: And here's the craziest thing- What? What? Yeah.
Speaker 1: Is that crazy? Do you think, okay, I always thought Hinckley was a lone nut that was infatuated with Jodie
Speaker 2: Foster.
Speaker 1: What? So- No, dude. And he actually, there's actually interviews, dude, where he said, Uncle George told me to do it. Oh, Jesus. Okay. Didn't they just let him out?
Speaker 2: He's doing, like, plain and coffee beans because he's put out an album or something like that.
Speaker 1: He's torn off it, but that's a crazy thing. Barack Obama, the 10th cousin once removed of George W. Bush through Samuel Hinckley of Cape Cod, holy shit. It's so crazy. I've never gone down the Hinckley rabbit hole. So John Hinckley, the guy who killed, or shot, rather, Reagan, what was his deal? Was he MK Ultra? He was like- MK Ultra? Yeah. He was a little off. He was like the one family member that was a little off. A little off. Here's the craziest thing about that thing. The Hinckley that shoots at Reagan, he's the first one that can use the, I'm mentally not capable of defending myself. I'm too mentally ill. What's the law where you can- Yeah. I know what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah. So, because right around then, John Lennon was also getting assassinated, and his killer tried to use that, I'm not mentally capable. Who killed John Lennon? Do we remember? What was his name? What was it? Dude, and I watched that whole story. Is there a rabbit hole to go down on that one too? That's a crazy story too, because we had this kind of, there was two eras of assassinations where everybody was getting assassinated. Or they were tempted. Chapman. Mark David Chapman. Shot and killed Lennon. Now, is he an MK Ultra guy too, you think? So he had that, what book did he have on the rye, what is it called? Catcher in the Rye. Catcher in the Rye. That's some MK Ultra shit right there.
Speaker 2: He's still alive?
Speaker 1: Is he still alive? 69 years old.
Speaker 2: Getting fucked in jail. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Wow. MK Ultra shit is left and right, dude. The second gunman, not Mark David Chapman, may have shot John Lennon. Author claims.
Speaker 2: Oh, author claims.
Speaker 1: Those authors. You never know. You know the- Nice to believe in authors. The door guy at his apartment building was a CIA, FBI spook.
Speaker 2: Jesus Christ.
Speaker 1: Yeah. They just load it up. When it's meant to happen, you don't get out of there. There's layers upon layers upon layers. That's why when you talk about any of these things that, even like when you talk about the Trump assassination, there's a lot of stuff I go, that's a little weird. That's a really weird situation right there. Because if you study these high impact events, it's kind of like that scene in John Wick. Do you know where John Wick, the hit goes out on him and he's in the plaza and now every assassin has a flip phone suddenly. They're all on flip phones and it's like, boom, take out John.
Speaker 2: That's a high impact event.
Speaker 1: There's layers upon layers upon layers where you're not getting out of there. Like 9-11, JFK.
Speaker 2: What is this, Jamie?
Speaker 1: Documents show CIA and FBI spied on John Lennon for fear of interrupting the election in 72. Which one was 72? Was that McGovern? I think that was when Hunter S. Thompson wrote Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail. McGovern and Nixon. Yeah. That was the one where Nixon won by the largest margin in history because McGovern's running mate turns out he was cuckoo and had gotten electroshock therapy and didn't tell anybody about it. Did you ever see the press conference when he announces that, bro, the dude looks like
Speaker 2: he just got out of the pool. He's fucking sweating. You thought Tim Walz was a bad VP. This guy, they're like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You can't be the vice president.
Speaker 1: If you study the Malcolm X assassination, the guy who is giving him mouth to mouth at the end is a New York police officer that was so undercover that even like the New York police didn't know about it. It was this crazy like secret group within the, they didn't even go through like getting their badges and anything like that. They were like separated early and then infiltrated all of these, these organizations. Like the guys who shot him were working with the FBI, the guy who's giving him CPR. But you know, this is my whole day. I always, you know, going back to the lizard people stuff at the beginning was like, yeah, if there wasn't this apex predator class like out there manipulating energy and manipulating people, like how much chaos would be happening in the world? You know, there always seems to be like, if you dig deeper, okay, there's an intelligence agent somewhere involved in that. And well, whenever you have money that's, I mean, this is back from war is a racket.
Speaker 2: This is like a Smedley Butler thing that he wrote in the 1930s.
Speaker 1: This is a guy who was a famous general. And after it was all over, he realized like his entire, all his years of service. Well, they, they approached him to do assassination. And he said, no, I won't do it. Like corporations wanted to assassinate, I think it was FDR. I'm not quite sure which the president was, but they approached him about basically doing a banker coup on the government. And he said he wouldn't do it. Jesus Christ.
Speaker 2: How crazy is that?
Speaker 1: There's been a few of those organized over the years, which is fucking terrifying.
Speaker 2: But this is just like what happens whenever people are in power, especially unchecked power. And, you know, this whole term, the deep state, people want to think of that as conspiracy
Speaker 1: theory. Okay. You have elected officials, elected officials have to get elected, but the people that run intelligence agencies don't have to get elected and they have massive access to money.
Speaker 2: And power.
Speaker 1: And power. And they don't want to leave that position.
Speaker 2: The business plot called the Wall Street push, Putsch, how do you say that? Putsch? P-U-T-S-C-H? Putsch?
Speaker 1: Whatever you attempt is good to me. Okay. The White House, a political conspiracy in 1933 in the United States to overthrow the government, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and install Smedley Butler as dictator.
Speaker 2: Butler, a retired Marine Corps major general, testified under oath that wealthy businessmen
Speaker 1: were plotting to create a fascist veterans organization with him as its leader and use it as a coup d'etat to overthrow Roosevelt. In 1934, Butler testified under oath before the United States House of Representatives Special Committee on Un-American Activities, the McCormick Dickinson's Dickstein, Dickstein, what an unfortunate name, committee on these revelations. Although no one was prosecuted, the congressional committee final report said there is no question that these attempts were discussed, were planned and might have been placed in execution when and if the financial backers deemed it expedient.
Speaker 2: Holy fuck, man.
Speaker 1: Holy fuck. Right?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: And it's so crazy to me, just hearing that is like, if you actually study FDR, he very much was a Wall Street puppet. He very much was in there doing their bidding and he had a lot like all this crazy stuff with Pearl Harbor, connections to Hitler, all this crazy stuff that people never hear about. And it's super interesting to me that when he's seen as a puppet of Wall Street, they're also trying to take him out. And also, if you think back then, there was no access to information.
Speaker 2: So they could do all this stuff like the assassination of Kennedy. They could do all this stuff and completely cover it up.
Speaker 1: There was no one had a chance. No one had a chance. And anybody who opened their mouth was dead. Anybody that opened their mouth wind up dying in suspicious circumstances. Yeah. So I just did an episode with a guy, he's called the dark journalist. That's the way he goes by. And he mind blown.
Speaker 2: He was telling me like, yeah, all the people that you think were involved in the assassination
Speaker 1: of JFK, they were involved. The intelligence agency, multiple intelligence agencies, the Federal Reserve, a bunch of people. One of the groups that I never heard of was basically the space program. Like the people who ran the space program of that time were involved in it because Kennedy wanted to share all the information they had on like UFOs and technologies with the Russians because he didn't want the Russians to think if they saw something weird in the sky, it was the US and like some kind of weird nuclear weapon. Yeah. So and you think about back then, who was involved in the space station? Say with me, Nazis who were brought over, you know, we discussed last time as Operation Paperclip. Yeah. I don't think the Nazis lost. I don't think they just crip walked over here and set up shop. Well, they definitely lost. But we took all the good ones that were engineers and scientists and Russia took the other ones. The only pushback I have on that, dude, is that if you're like, if it's some kind of thing where we're sneaking them over, they're bringing them over. Like nobody changes their names. Like everybody didn't have to sneak them over. They were brought under the protection of the United States government and no one could know if they were Nazis. There was no information. Yeah, but von Bonn had his name and he was like on trial. Everyone's like, oh, we got this Nazi over here. Simon Wiesenthal Center said that if von Bonn was alive today, they would charge him with crimes against humanity.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: They hung the five slowest Jews in their rocket factory in Berlin to motivate people to work harder.
Speaker 2: It's so crazy. So they were all Nazis. So if you think about the Nazis hated the Russians and he wanted to share all this information with the Russians and they did not like that at all.
Speaker 1: And here's the craziest thing. I was like, oh, what do I want to tell Joe? Here's the craziest thing. I've had people on my show talking about this.
Speaker 2: Like there is a belief out there that the head, the head of the, the, the power pyramid of intelligence agencies is NASA.
Speaker 1: Because if you think about this, it's the one thing that everybody wants to work together on. We're possibly in some, we're having this weird kind of nuclear standoff with Russians, but somehow some way we're all working on a space station together. That and Antarctica are the two things where everyone like puts their differences aside.
Speaker 2: We're like, let's all work together.
Speaker 1: And it's like, there is this real belief that the head of the snake of the intelligence agencies, which is, which is like a Mossad, CIA, MI6 is NASA space station is the NASA organization.
Speaker 2: Yeah. The thing that would make that plausible is if the knowledge of alien life is absolute, absolute, real. And they have to protect that information from getting out.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I mean, it's interesting to me because it's the one thing everybody works on. Even Antarctica is like, they're all in on this treaty.
