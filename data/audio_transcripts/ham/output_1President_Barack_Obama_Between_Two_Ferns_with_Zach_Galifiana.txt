Speaker 2: I have to get my great aunt some d-
Speaker 1: last week and I had diabetes shoes and uh it's no problem
Speaker 2: You know what, Zach? I have to say, when I heard that people actually watch this show, I was actually- like actually pretty surprised 
Speaker 1: hi welcome to another edition of between two ferns I'm your host Zach Galifianakis and my guest today is uh president
Speaker 2: Barack Obama. Barack Obama. Good to be with you, Zach.
Speaker 1: First of all, in 2013, you partied in a turkey. What do you have planned for 2014? 
Speaker 2: We'll probably pardon another turkey. We do that every Thanksgiving. Was that depressing to you, seeing one turkey kind of taken out of circulation, a turkey you couldn't eat?
Speaker 1: so how does this work do you say sitting hulk hogan Would you send Ambassador Rodman to North Korea on your behalf? I read somewhere that you'd be sending him to Syria. Or is that more of a job for Tonya Harding? 
Speaker 2: Zach, he's not our ambassador. What should we do about North Ikea? Why don't we move on?
Speaker 1: I have to know the last black president What is it like to be the last president?
Speaker 2: Seriously, what's it like for this to be the last time you ever talk to a president?
Speaker 1: well it must kind of stink on you know three times
Speaker 2: You don't think, though, that you can't run a third time, you know? No, actually, I think it's a good idea. You know, if I ran a third time, it'd be sort of like doing a third Hangover movie. Didn't really work out very well, did it? Now, I have to say that I've seen this show before, and some of the episodes have probably been a little bit better than this.
Speaker 1: uh
Speaker 2: For example, the one with Bradley Cooper, that was a great movie. Bradley Cooper, everybody loves him. He kind of carried that movie, didn't he?
Speaker 1:  which which film are you speaking of
Speaker 2: Those Hangover movies, basically he carried them. Yeah, everybody loves Bradley.
Speaker 1: Good for him. Good-looking guy. Being like that in Hollywood, that's easy. Tall, handsome, that's easy. Be short, fat, and smell like Doritos and try to make it to Hollywood. Is it going to be hard in two years when you're no longer president and people will stop letting you win at basketball? 
Speaker 2:How does it feel having a three-inch? A three-inch horizontal.
Speaker 1: Where are you planning on building your presidential library, in Hawaii or your home country of Kenya? Both places seem like they would be…
Speaker 2: Zach, that's a ridiculous question.
Speaker 1: well you know birth certificate thing but you really never did really
Speaker 2: Where's your birth certificate? Why don't you show it to us right now? 
Speaker 1: I don't want to show anybody my birth certificate. It's embarrassing on it it says pounds 800 ounces You know what I would do if I were president, Mr. President?
Speaker 2: What would you do?
Speaker 1: I would make same-sex divorce illegal didn't see how bad they want it
Speaker 2: I think that's Why you're not president. good thing
Speaker 1: you said if you had a son You would not let him play football. What makes you think that he would want to play football? What if he was a nerd like you?
Speaker 2: Do you think a woman like Michelle would marry a nerd? Why don't you ask her whether she thinks I'm a nerd?
Speaker 1: could I so do you go to any websites that are you mainly just stick with dot gov's
Speaker 2: No, I'm not going to let her near you. .coms or .nets or do you… No, actually we go to .govs. Have you heard of healthcare.gov? Health…
Speaker 1: here we go okay let's get this out plug
Speaker 2: By the way, what did you come here to… Well, first of all, I think it's fair to say that I wouldn't be with you here today if I didn't have something to plug. Have you heard of the Affordable Care Act?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I heard about that. That's the thing that doesn't work. Why don't you get the guy that created the Zune to make your website?
Speaker 2: Healthcare.gov works great now. And millions of Americans have already gotten health insurance plans. And what we want is for people to know that you can get affordable healthcare. And most young Americans right now, they're not covered. And the truth is that they can get coverage all for what it costs you to pay your cell phone bill.
Speaker 1: Is this what they mean by drones? The point is that a lot of young people, they think they're invincible.
Speaker 2: No, no, not invisible. Invincible.
Speaker 1: did you say invisible because uh
Speaker 2: Meaning that they don't think they can get hurt. I understand that.
Speaker 1: I'm just saying that nobody could be invisible if you had said invisible
Speaker 2: If they get that health insurance, it can really make a big difference. And they've got until March 31st to sign up. You can call 1-800-318-2596.
Speaker 1: I have a computer so how does well then you're I don't have a phone I'm off the grid I don't want you people like looking at my text if you know what I mean
Speaker 2: First of all, Zach, nobody's interested in your texts. But second of all, you can do it in person. And the law means that insurers can't discriminate against you if you've got a pre-existing condition anymore. Yeah, but what about...
Speaker 1: what about this though
Speaker 2: How long have you had that? I'll tell you.
Speaker 1: just four months really spider bites I got attacked by spiders
Speaker 2: Zach, you need to get that checked right away. You need to get on healthcare.gov because...
Speaker 1: because
Speaker 2: That's one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen. Is your plug finally over?
Speaker 1: I suppose so. So which country were you rooting for in the Winter Olympics?
Speaker 2: Seriously? The President of the United States. What do you think, Zach?
Speaker 1: I want to thank
Speaker 2: President Obama for being on the show? I'm going to end this. Don't touch that, please.
Speaker 1: shh
Speaker 2: I'm going to end this.
Speaker 1: thanks for um thanks for letting me shoot my show here all these years
Speaker 2: I heard the interview and... You've been shooting these shows here in the diplomatic room? Who gave you permission to do that?
Speaker 1: bush what's the spider bite
Speaker 2: Seriously? Who gave him clearance? That's the other hand. No, it's everywhere.
