Speaker 1: Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no.
Speaker 2: And I would have to say pah-huh.
Speaker 1: What?
Speaker 2: Do you not remember the puppet guy?
Speaker 1: Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
Speaker 2: And his puppet too.
Speaker 1: Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date.
Speaker 2: Who?
Speaker 1: Paul.
Speaker 2: Oh.
Speaker 1: Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30.
Speaker 2: Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29.
Speaker 1: Not uh, not to my recollection.
Speaker 2: Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me.
Speaker 1: Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
Speaker 2: Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
Speaker 1: Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
Speaker 2: One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
