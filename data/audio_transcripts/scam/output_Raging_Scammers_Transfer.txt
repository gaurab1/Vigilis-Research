Speaker 1: Oh, I'm fine. 
Speaker 2: And if you don't mind, how old are you? 
Speaker 1: Well, the other gentleman had asked and I'm going to be 81 on December 25th. 
Speaker 2: Oh my God, your voice like this, 40 years old, if you don't mind. 
Speaker 1: I never really get to talk to anybody ever, so I'm very appreciative because I've been alone for the past 25 years. Nobody even wishes me happy birthday. 
Speaker 2: Okay, log in to your online banking and once you log in, let me know, okay? 
Speaker 1: Okay. 
Speaker 2: And in which account do you want the money ma'am?

Speaker 1: What do you mean? Why, what happened? 
Speaker 2: You put $46,000, you can see that over here. Oh my God, let me check your account ma'am, just wait. You can see that $46,000 has been transferred into your checking account, you can see that. Okay. You can see just by mistakenly ma'am, you put an extra zero and we don't have a permission to take out any single penny from our customer's account. So what do you need to do ma'am? You have to go to the bank and I will give you our company's bank account, you can go to the bank and do the wire transfer to our company's bank account.

Speaker 2: Once you reach to the bank parking place, talk to me once so I can explain you that what you need to do inside the bank, okay? 
Speaker 1: Okay. I'm on the line. Do I call you back or what do I need to do?
Speaker 2: Do not hang up, do not hang up the call. Once you reach to the bank parking place, then let me know, okay? 
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: You there? Was someone saying sake or something over the phone? Yeah. Did someone take his name? Hello, where is the $20,000? The $20,000 that you just took out from the bank. How's that?
Speaker 2: Hey. What about that?
