Speaker 1: from your account to someone else's account. So that's why we have sent you this confirmation email to confirm it, whether that was you or not, okay? It's in a balance board with twisting board, board yoga, fitness plate, stability, this
Speaker 2: I'll offer $80, that's the most I'm going to pay for that product.
Speaker 1: anti-training balance gym for size for my head and fill out this form. Ma'am, ma'am, still not understand.
Speaker 2: Take it or leave it.
Speaker 1: To log in once you in Duluth strong.
Speaker 2: Okay, so what do you mean?
Speaker 1: I said you need to log in into your online bank.
Speaker 2: Why do I have to log in there?
Speaker 1: Make instant transfer your bank and our bank. Both bank needs to be connected. Once you will log in after that, I will log in and I will transfer.
Speaker 2: What are you doing ma'am?
Speaker 1: What are you doing?
Speaker 2: I just wanted to verify.
Speaker 1: And I believe on the enter button.
Speaker 2: Significantly overcharged for this product. I don't see.
Speaker 1: You want to verify.
Speaker 2: I don't see any products for the $500.
Speaker 1: Send to me first.
Speaker 2: I'm going to give it to America because I'm spoofing their demo and I don't know if we
Speaker 1: Let me refund you that money. After that, you can whatever you want. Okay. And I'm going to log in into my company's bank account. It is on your screen. As we work under security. That's right. No, don't do anything, ma'am.
Speaker 2: can both use it. I think I might need to restart my computer. Don't.
Speaker 1: Do anything. We are working on it.
Speaker 2: I'm going.
Speaker 1: To log in into my bank. That's why it's back.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and just go ahead and restart it quick because it says work
Speaker 1: Don't do it. Don't you don't. Sure. Don't do anything. What do you have on the screen? No problem.
Speaker 2: securely again. I think there might be a problem. I don't want to buy a balance board, weight lifting, yoga board, fitness, Pilates, yada
Speaker 1: You don't understand what I'm trying to say. I said I'm doing that.
Speaker 2: yada, workout, four in three, never worn, cloud saving, Bluetooth enabled, bind on, pick up, plus three resistance to undead exercise equipment.
Speaker 1: No, it's our bank.
Speaker 2: You know? It literally says it's an online.
Speaker 1: From here, I will transfer your $600 to your bank. I will give you a cancellation form that you need to fill out. Okay. On your screen. This form is from Bank of America. They will verify you and deposit the money in your account.
Speaker 2: So you can see he's just editing the HTML right in front of me.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Not even bothering to hide.
Speaker 1: Any form on your screen is starting with your account. This is the refund form from Bank of America. You need to type your information, ma'am, not mine. You are getting the refund. I'm not getting a refund.
Speaker 2: Oh. Hmm, nickname. Ah, God, we need a good one. We need a good nickname.
Speaker 1: I told you, ma'am.
Speaker 2: Mother Toad?
Speaker 1: What do you think? You didn't put your email address.
Speaker 2: I like that. I like toads. Did you say something? The dude's fuming over there. Heart rate going up. Breathing rate increasing.
Speaker 1: What is your balance of your checking account?
Speaker 2: $3,070 and 14 pennies.
Speaker 1: Remember this balance, okay?
Speaker 2: Nickels and four pennies. Okay, so you can see because of the transparency, normally the screen wouldn't be transparent. So everything he's doing would be hidden.
Speaker 1: You will get your money back, okay? But...
Speaker 2: They sent money in between my bank accounts and they're just editing the HTML kind of like he did a minute ago. To say online transfer from Bank of America. He's actually editing the wrong spot. Um, but the idea is that I technically would have $6,000 in my own account.
Speaker 1: The confirmation is from your bank. It came from my bank. Refund the money. So, check your balance. Okay. And tell me, did you get your money?
Speaker 2: You didn't have to send that much.
Speaker 1: How much you got?
Speaker 2: $6,000.
Speaker 1: $6,000.
Speaker 2: I thought you were going to send $600.
Speaker 1: She is not letting me speak.
Speaker 2: $600.
Speaker 1: I talked to my bank. And they said on the refund form...
Speaker 2: We should talk to Rob.
Speaker 1: On $6,000. That's why they have sent you the $6,000. Robin is not there. I'm handling this case.
Speaker 2: Okay, but in the words of Shaggy, it wasn't me.
Speaker 1: Now listen to me.
Speaker 2: Okay, let's round it off to an even $5,000.

Speaker 2: What?
Speaker 1: Did you get the card?
Speaker 2: Do you see the apples?

Speaker 2: Exercise equipment.
Speaker 1: I'm not listening to you. You give me the card numbers. At the back of the card you will see card numbers. Okay.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I was just watching. There was a little video about how to do it. It says that you have to redeem it.
Speaker 1: I want you to take a picture. What are you doing, ma'am?
Speaker 2: Let me see if this will work.
Speaker 1: Don't do anything. No, don't do anything.
Speaker 2: Let me know if this will go through.
Speaker 1: No, don't do anything. You know, it's our job.
Speaker 2: It looks like 500 went through.
Speaker 1: We will take it. Okay. You don't have to take anything.
Speaker 2: This is how you do it, right?
Speaker 1: Just close that page.
Speaker 2: I watched the video.
Speaker 1: True, ma'am. What are you doing? I told you not to do anything.
Speaker 2: Let me get the next one for you. I don't mind doing this stuff either because, you know, I'm not going to get paid for it.
Speaker 1: Don't do anything. Ma'am, I told you don't do anything.
Speaker 2: I don't mind doing this stuff either because, you know, I like to make sure everyone gets fair is fair.

Speaker 1: ...
Speaker 2: I can get that to you maybe tomorrow or Friday. They're now connected on three different computers. And they just don't know what's going on. I think they're all just sort of stunned. They've got three computers connected to me, trying to figure out why they can't control my screen. I don't know if they're just like lost hope. They're just huddling in silence.
Speaker 1: Now, for your computer, just turn it off.
Speaker 2: Oh, you know what?
Speaker 1: Computer and turn it back on.
Speaker 2: I gave you the wrong...

Speaker 1: That day, you... ... Buy the Google... ...
Speaker 2: I don't want you to miss out on the $4,000. But my grandson said normally you don't buy... You normally don't pay people gift cards.
Speaker 1: ...cannot accept money from bank. That's why the gift card is for gifting purpose. ...
Speaker 2: All right, let me head to my house. And on the way I'll get some cards. Hi, it's Cheryl Andrews. I got the cards that you asked for.

Speaker 2: Oh, little... Little baby. I'm just going to write... Oops.
