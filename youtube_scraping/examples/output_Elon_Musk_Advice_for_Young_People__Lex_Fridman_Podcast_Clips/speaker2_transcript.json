  "transcript": "Try to be useful. Do things that are useful to your fellow human beings, to the world. It's very hard to be useful. Very hard. You know, are you contributing more than you consume? You know, like, can you try to have a positive net contribution to society? I think that's the thing to aim for. You know, not to try to be sort of a leader for the sake of being a leader or whatever. A lot of time, the people you want as leaders are the people who don't want to be leaders. So if you can live a useful life, that is a good life. A life worth having lived. You know, and like I said, I would encourage people to use the mental tools of physics and apply them broadly in life. They are the best tools. I would encourage people to read a lot of books. Basically, try to ingest as much information as you can. And try to also just develop a good general knowledge. So you at least have a rough lay of the land of the knowledge landscape. Try to learn a little bit about a lot of things. Because you might not know what you're really interested in. How would you know what you're really interested in if you at least aren't doing a peripheral exploration broadly of the knowledge landscape? And talk to people from different walks of life and different industries and professions and skills and occupations. Just try to learn as much as possible. And search for meaning. Yeah, what's the meaning of life? But just generally, like I said, I would encourage people to read broadly in many different subject areas. And then try to find something where there's an overlap of what you're interested in. So people may be good at something, or they may have skill at a particular thing, but they don't like doing it. So you want to try to find a thing where that's a good combination of the things that you're inherently good at, but you also like doing. And... Where are you... You've got to learn about things somehow. So reading a broad range. Just really read it. You know, when I was a kid, I read through the encyclopedia. So that was pretty helpful. And all sorts of things I didn't even know existed. Well, a lot, obviously. Encyclopedias were digestible, I think, you know, whatever, 40 years ago. So, you know, maybe read through the condensed version of the Encyclopedia Britannica. I'd recommend that. You can always skip subjects where you read a few paragraphs and know you're not interested. Just jump to the next one. So read the encyclopedia or skim through it. But I put a lot of stock and certainly have a lot of respect for someone who puts in an honest day's work to do useful things. And just generally to have not a zero-sum mindset, or have more of a grow-the-pie mindset. If you sort of say, like, when we see people, like, perhaps, including some very smart people, kind of taking an attitude of, like, doing things that seem morally questionable, it's often because they have, at a base, sort of axiomatic level, a zero-sum mindset. And they, without realizing it, they don't realize they have a zero-sum mindset. Or at least they don't realize it consciously. And so if you have a zero-sum mindset, then the only way to get ahead is by taking things from others. If the pie is fixed, then the only way to have more pie is to take someone else's pie. But this is false. Like, obviously, the pie has grown dramatically over time, the economic pie. So, in reality, you can have, to overuse this analogy, there's a lot of pie. Pie is not fixed. So you really want to make sure you're not operating, without realizing it, from a zero-sum mindset. Where the only way to get ahead is to take things from others. Then that's going to result in you trying to take things from others, which is not good. It's much better to work on adding to the economic pie. Like I said, creating more than you consume. So that's a big deal. I think there's a fair number of people in finance that do have a bit of a zero-sum mindset. Yeah, exactly. Thank you.",
