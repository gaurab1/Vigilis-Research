  "transcript": "Like I mentioned with SpaceX, you give a lot of people hope, and a lot of people look up to you, millions of people look up to you. If we think about young people in high school, maybe in college, what advice would you give to them about, if they wanna try to do something big in this world, they wanna really have a big positive impact, what advice would you give them about their career in general? When you think about education and self-education, what do you recommend? So there's the university, there's self-study, there is a hands-on sort of finding a company or a place or a set of people that do the thing you're passionate about and joining them as early as possible. There's taking a road trip across Europe for a few years and writing some poetry, which I think is a great way to get to know people and writing some poetry, which trajectory do you suggest? In terms of learning about how you can become useful, as you mentioned, how you can have the most positive impact. Thank you. Isn't the whole thing the search for meaning? You Your talents You Hmm and reading is a super fast shortcut to to figure out which You both good at it. You like doing it and it will actually have positive impact You You brought as it gets You You You You You You You You You So You I mean, it's all walks of life. I've seen that one of the one of the reasons Rogan inspires me is he celebrates all there's a lot. There's not not creating a constant competition Like there's a scarcity of resources what happens when you celebrate others and you promote others The ideas of others it it it actually grows that pie I mean it every like the the resource be the resources become less scarce And that that applies in a lot of kinds of domains that applies in academia where a lot of people are very See some funding for academic research is zero sum And it is not if you celebrate each other if you make if you get everybody to be excited about AI about physics above Mathematics, I think it there'd be more and more funding and I think everybody wins. Yeah that applies. I think broadly Yeah You",
