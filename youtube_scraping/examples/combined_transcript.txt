Speaker 1: Thank you for calling support, how can I help you?
Speaker 2: Thank you. No shot. I keep getting messages on the computer that says my PC is in danger. I tried to register. That way my PC wouldn't be in danger anymore.
Speaker 1: Let me connect your computer with us and let me check why you are getting these kind of
Speaker 2: A lot of viruses, I think problems.
Speaker 1: things. I got it.
Speaker 1: How long you are getting problems?
Speaker 2: The past six months. I don't know what the heck this thing is. I try to close it out and it just keeps popping up more.
Speaker 1: Leave your mouse.
Speaker 2: Don't know what the heck that is. I'm just trying to, I usually just move them, you know, off the screen.
Speaker 1: Leave it.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: Leave your mouse.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Leave your mouse.
Speaker 2: I'll let you take care of it since you're the expert.
Speaker 1: Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. Leave it.
Speaker 2: Oh, I forgot I upgraded my computer with more cores.
Speaker 1: Leave it. Your computer is hacked.
Speaker 2: Oh God. It's not the hacker known as 4chan, is it? What is this? Bonzi, the Intelligent Interactive Traveling Companion for the World Wide Web.
Speaker 1: Go ahead.
Speaker 2: He helps me traverse through the internet.
Speaker 1: Let me find out why you're getting this problem, okay?
Speaker 2: How long have you been working on computers?
Speaker 1: I've been working for the last 11 years.
Speaker 2: Let me show you.
Speaker 1: Like a master's in computer science. Wow. And after that in networking. I work with different, different companies. This is your IP address, 192.168.0.7.
Speaker 2: Where did you come up with that number? Because that's not the number on the screen.
Speaker 1: Oh my goodness.
Speaker 2: Computer. Oh God.
Speaker 1: It's a very, very critical condition in your computer.
Speaker 2: Computer. No. No, I have, I have corn outside though. No. Corn.
Speaker 1: Do you watch porn on the computer?
Speaker 2: Corn. I didn't notice, but he uploaded porn to my computer. Really? For scientific research purposes, can you? Where are they?
Speaker 1: No, no.
Speaker 2: Corn.
Speaker 1: Who watch the porn on the computer?
Speaker 2: Corn. Corn.
Speaker 1: Website.
Speaker 2: Corn. Corn.
Speaker 1: Because there's a lot of pornographic content in your computer.
Speaker 2: Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn.
Speaker 1: I didn't watch porn on the computer.
Speaker 2: Corn. Corn.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: Corn.
Speaker 1: For sure.
Speaker 2: Corn. Corn. Corn. Where are they? Good heavens. Do you see?
Speaker 1: See, these things.
Speaker 2: Tiny little computer. God almighty. How did you put those on there? He claimed that hackers uploaded it and that I had to pay a bunch of money for security.
Speaker 1: It will be 101% safe.
Speaker 2: Computer. I promise to you. Uh oh. That's a little bit of a problem.
Speaker 1: You did here.
Speaker 2: What? Just fake popups? I don't know. Can I just close? Yeah, just close up. Just close up.
Speaker 1: You can close these.
Speaker 2: No, I don't. I don't know how. This guy was so desperate he gave me his company's name and wire information, which I obviously reported to bank front professionals. Quick question for you.
Speaker 1: You can close these things.
Speaker 2: Why did you upload pornography to my computer?
Speaker 1: Can you do it?
Speaker 2: I mean, it very specifically says in the chat log, pornography. I mean, it's not really my company's name. I just wrote that down. It's not my company's name. I'm not a hacker. I don't know. I don't know how. I don't know. I don't know how. I just wrote that down. I don't know how. I don't know how. I just wrote that down. I don't know how. I just wrote that down. I don't know how. I mean, it, it very specifically says in the chat log that it says certified text created
Speaker 1: Go ahead and upload.
Speaker 2: that. Oh, don't scroll down certified tech created, the directory C users, personal documents torn. And then I started receiving a bunch of higher fourth form.
Speaker 1: I'm talking to you.
Speaker 2: You are not going to pay. You did it.
Speaker 1: And you are trying to make me fool, okay?
Speaker 2: I know you very well. Okay. Why did you upload pornography to my computer?
Speaker 1: I don't watch porn on the computer.
Speaker 2: I didn't. Okay. It says you did right there. It says certified tech created the directory. You see that? Oh, you hung up already. I decided to add a few more viruses for good measure and call another scammer. How did she become a pop star? Computer running swell? Well, heck yes, it is. And I'll click them, but they never seem to fix the problem. Viruses. Terrible thing.
Speaker 1: There really is a significant amount of malware.
Speaker 2: I'm actually a little surprised he could even use the computer.
Speaker 1: From the operating system of your computer. You just need to watch what I'm doing. I believe that you're using Windows on your computer.
Speaker 2: It's very slow. I think it's Windows.
Speaker 1: This is your Windows computer.
Speaker 2: I'm not sure though. I sent an email.
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes, ma'am. It is one of the most advanced. And it's an intelligent operating system. Okay? Windows 10. The brain part of the computer. This is a smart machine. Whenever it finds out that there are any problems on the computer.
Speaker 2: It's, oh, the goose wants to honk.
Speaker 1: It will automatically give you a system. We will be able to fix these problems. Okay. This could be the driver. My drivers are stopped.
Speaker 2: What problems are they exactly?
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: He's going through the script.
Speaker 1: We will just show it to you. Okay. These are the drivers. This is the description of the drivers. These are the windows.
Speaker 2: But there's actual malware living on the computer.
Speaker 1: No drivers. Do you see all these drivers are stopped in the computer? Do you see these drivers stopping?
Speaker 2: And he's just lying about it, which I don't know why he's doing that. The reason that I'm having so many problems with the computer is because some of the drivers
Speaker 1: All right. That's it. Okay, let's stop. No drivers.
Speaker 2: are stopped.
Speaker 1: That is one of the things.
Speaker 2: I'm a fast learner. Drivers might be stopped, but this brain isn't stopped, buddy.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 2: I'm a fast learner.
Speaker 1: You got that correct, mom. You got that absolutely right. So the drivers... I got it. Yeah. I got it. Now, over here, if you just check the system security over a period of time, all right, it might actually say that I...
Speaker 2: Drivers might be stopped, but this brain isn't stopped, buddy. 
Speaker 1: Active malware protection.
Speaker 2: Since there are no reports, the computer is just fine.
Speaker 1: Oh, it doesn't. Clear. No, ma'am. Fine.
Speaker 2: Okay, I'm going to start the drivers.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's important. That's action item number one.
Speaker 2: Nevermind.
Speaker 1: Action item number one.
Speaker 2: There's something wrong with the computer.
Speaker 1: Yes. So that is how the things would work.
Speaker 2: I'm going to restart it. Uh oh. Are you an idiot? No.
Speaker 1: You are an idiot.
Speaker 2: I think you.
Speaker 1: These messages, I'm not...
Speaker 2: No, I would never call you an idiot.
Speaker 1: I'm not an idiot, ma'am. I'm... I told you the problem is...
Speaker 2: That just came up on the computer.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: I think it might be the molar. He won't be able to turn him off. Like, he's, it's just. I'm not going to be able to fill out his little form that he wants me to fill out.
Speaker 1: I will just type in our toll-free number for your future support.
Speaker 2: Kind of clear up.
Speaker 1: Sure. Thank you. I will give you the...
Speaker 2: Just get some of this sorted out. That way we can focus on the name.
Speaker 1: Of the company. Sure, ma'am.
Speaker 2: You're just going to plow her through it.
Speaker 1: Oh, freshen up, ma'am. You can come. Quiet it, ma'am. You would like... Oh, sure.
Speaker 2: Is this normal?
Speaker 1: Which card would you be paying it to?
Speaker 2: I think I got to think about it.
Speaker 1: All right. So you can think about it.
Speaker 2: I feel like you might have lied a little bit.
Speaker 1: I'm out of the computer now, ma'am. Okay?
Speaker 2: Is it?
Speaker 1: We didn't lie to you, ma'am.
Speaker 2: I don't have anything to do with it.
Speaker 1: I've told you the problems are there. So I'm out of the computer now. All right? Thank you. Bye-bye.
Speaker 2: It's this 200 malware files that I downloaded. Not the drivers. Why'd you say the drivers? I had a ton of fun with this video and a few ideas for what I could do next, but I would love to hear from you. What viruses, what chaos can I bring to these scammers? Let me know in the comments. And if you enjoyed the video or learned a few things, share it with a friend. As always, know that you are valuable and you matter, and I will see you in the next video. Bye!
