Speaker 1: Are you listening to me?
Speaker 2: You can keep it in your pocket just in case you ever need.
Speaker 1: So this is what you're going to buy now.
Speaker 2: For my son.
Speaker 1: Do you know how much it will cost you?
Speaker 2: Oh, shoot.
Speaker 1: Now let me refund you the amount. All right.
Speaker 2: Yeah, I'm going to need it.
Speaker 1: You paid them $88,000 just to buy a silver coin.
Speaker 2: It's not just any silver coin. That's a, that's an Illinois set right there.
Speaker 1: You know how much it costs?
Speaker 2: That was once $1, you know, it's an investment opportunity.

Speaker 2: I got a price. I got a price check this tarp.
Speaker 1: Why did you call me? Why did you close that page?
Speaker 2: Oh, sorry. I just want to make sure I don't forget a tarp for my boat.
Speaker 1: The scammers sent $8,000 of my own money to the checking account. This is a command prompt, but they call it the banking server to make it seem like something official is happening. It's just a trick. First, you need to tell me, is this your cell phone or home phone?
Speaker 2: Listen, all I know is my iPad says I got $7,900 in my checking and I don't know what's going on.
Speaker 1: Okay. Do you know any grocery store nearby you? No. Did you heard about gift card?
Speaker 2: Tell me about it. Are you there? Yeah. I'm trying to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing.
Speaker 1: Yes, I can hear you. He's a little suspicious. Yes, I'm here with you. I'm sorry. Show me your full face. I'm sorry. You're supposed to go outside. You're supposed to buy gift card. Is it? From CVS Pharmacy. Is it?
Speaker 2: Me out there?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry. Bald. Bald. Okay, are you bald?
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Like, do you have hair in your head?
Speaker 2: How did you know that? Can you see me?
Speaker 1: Okay. No, I didn't see you. After watching me spend almost all of my money, their last resort is to ask for a Visa Vanilla gift card. So I pretend to go to the store, pick up some gift cards, and come back home.
Speaker 2: I'm sorry they didn't have, they didn't have, they didn't have any vanilla flavored cards like you said. They just had vanilla.
Speaker 1: Hell, I scream. No worry. No worry. I'm asking you about the Google Play gift card.
Speaker 2: Gift card. Google card.
Speaker 1: Yes, type it. Type it.
Speaker 2: Is that what you're talking about? FB57. You know, on the back it says open the play store. Scratch the label off.
Speaker 1: You just need to write down the numbers only. Only the 16-digit number. Nothing else. Okay, hold on a second. Just make it...
Speaker 2: Quick. It says P.
Speaker 1: Just make it quick.
Speaker 2: It has instructions on the back. I don't know if this is what you're supposed to do or not.
Speaker 1: What do you see now? What are you doing now? Don't open Google Play. You don't have to look for instructions. You have to listen to me only.
Speaker 2: I know my grandson uses Google.
Speaker 1: Just listen to me. Just write down the numbers. Instead of immediately redeeming the gift card, I'm going to type it wrong on the notepad. Okay.
Speaker 2: So how does it work?
Speaker 1: Write down the second card number over there.
Speaker 2: Do you have a hunch about how we're going to take care of the rest of the money or are you okay if I buy a boat tarp?
Speaker 1: No, sir. That will not work. If you will do so, I'll lose my job.
Speaker 2: Yeah, but if I don't have a boat tarp, what happens to my boat?
Speaker 1: I'll tell you.
Speaker 2: I'll tell you. Are you sure? I mean, I don't have to get...
Speaker 1: Where are you now? Open your notepad. Open your notepad. Do you see the notepad?
Speaker 2: Buy the $7,000 one. It's just I need something. I don't want to lose my...
Speaker 1: Do you see... So you got only three cards, right? Each for 500.
Speaker 2: Yeah.
Speaker 1: IWBQ.
Speaker 2: Huh?
Speaker 1: One minute, sir. Just one minute. Oh, there we go. They're checking it on another computer right now. So, theoretically... Theoretically, any second, they'll be like, Sir, these cards aren't right. Hopefully, they'll fall into my trap.
Speaker 2: Well, it's hard because some of these cards, the numbers are hard to...
Speaker 1: You gave me the wrong card number. The first one. Do you see FB57, the first one?
Speaker 2: The numbers in the letters, they look the same, you know? Is there a way to check? How do you know whether there's money on there or not? You give...
Speaker 1: You gave me the wrong card number, sir.
Speaker 2: Uh, okay.
Speaker 1: Hold on. What are you doing now?
Speaker 2: I'm going to check it to make sure it's working here.
Speaker 1: I'm trying to...
Speaker 2: Oh, you know what, sir?
Speaker 1: I'm sorry about that.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it's... I can't tell if it's an 8 or a B. The 8s and the Bs look the same.
Speaker 1: Here. On 8th to 8th, GS.
Speaker 2: Okay, so it says you are...
Speaker 1: Give a click on complete.
Speaker 2: Okay.
Speaker 1: You did it.
Speaker 2: I think there's money on it.
Speaker 1: I think...
Speaker 2: I think there's money on it. There's money on it.
Speaker 1: Sir, you got 500. You didn't give me the... You already add your card in your account, sir. And what about the second one?
Speaker 2: Some of them are on. I wonder if we're going to have the same problem here.
Speaker 1: Second one is right?
Speaker 2: I don't know. Let me...
Speaker 1: Listen to me. You don't have to add. Listen to me.
Speaker 2: Let me see if I... Let me make sure there's money on it before you guys waste too much of your time. I definitely think this last one is an 8, not a B, though.
Speaker 1: Now, don't give a click on complete. Give a click on cancel. Give a click on cancel.
Speaker 2: What was that?
Speaker 1: What were you saying? You gave me the wrong card number, sir. You bastard. There's $500 on the second one.
Speaker 2: But as well, we've got to switch... Let me make sure the third card works as well. Yeah, I'm tracking with you.
Speaker 1: Are you listening? Are you listening to me, sir? If you can open your Google account, $1,000 is back to you, okay? So you have not paid a single money to us.
Speaker 2: This last card, though. Let me see if this one... Oh, yeah.
Speaker 1: Yes, yes, do whatever you like. You can do it. No problem. This guy's the calm like... The other guy got mad and then... How come? It didn't work. Like, I hope you have only paid to us $1,500. Maybe he wants to play it cool because he's like, dude, look. He bought some gift cards. Maybe we can get more.
Speaker 2: $5,000.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now, I hope you know how much rest of the money you want to give it back to me.
Speaker 2: $5,000.
Speaker 1: Okay, all right. Now, if I give you an account number, will you be able to go to the bank and make a wire transfer?
Speaker 2: I mean, I could give it a shot. If not, I'd be willing to buy this $5,000 thick camping tarp with grime in it. I could send it your way, but if you'd rather me do the wire, I can give that a shot.
Speaker 1: He believes it. Okay, yes, sir.
Speaker 2: I don't know.
Speaker 1: I can give you an account number because buying gift cards is going to be a problem, you know? And the stores will not allow you to buy that much of gift cards.
Speaker 2: If you want, I can do two $2,500 tarps. No.
Speaker 1: No, no, no, sir. No, no, no, sir.
Speaker 2: $2,500 tarps. I...
Speaker 1: Okay, I don't want gift cards.
Speaker 2: $2,500. I don't...
Speaker 1: No.
Speaker 2: How many employees?
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no. I spent another hour or so talking to these guys and they frantically searched for a bank account.
Speaker 2: $2,500.
Speaker 1: But when they started asking me to go buy more gift cards, I realized they weren't going to be able to get an account to launder money.
Speaker 2: I'm going to go grab a bite to eat, but I promise I'll take care of it tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: So...
Speaker 1: Okay, you don't have to go inside the bank.
Speaker 2: Okay, talk to you later.
Speaker 1: No, sir. Do one thing. Just go ahead and get the gift card again.
Speaker 2: Okay, bye. The last time. Call me tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Listen to me.
Speaker 2: No. No. F*** you, you motherf***er.
Speaker 1: You do.
Speaker 2: Sorry, I think you got the wrong number. Sorry.
Speaker 1: I hope you had a chance to laugh and learn a few things while you watched this.
Speaker 2: You got the wrong number.
Speaker 1: As always, know that you matter
Speaker 2: F*** you.
Speaker 1: and that you're valued. See you in the next video.
Speaker 2: Bye. Bye.
Speaker 1: You
