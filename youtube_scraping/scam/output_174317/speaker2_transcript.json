  "transcript": "How should I get you the money? Like write a check I could call my eldest daughter, Nina. Outside the dome? Are you talking about the Thunderdome? Are you a Mad Max fan? I used to spend hours watching Mad Max and daydreaming, just simply salivating at the thought of sitting next to Mad Max on one of those bikes. There's a Walgreens down the street that Nina gets my prescriptions from. I would say probably 15 minutes. Right. Give or take, yes. I believe so. And unless the previous technician can tell you I'm 81 years old. Yes, well the Walgreens. Yes, there is a 24-7. I think we could go there. What do you need me to go there for? Security tools. Well, if I had Nina come pick me up, I imagine that it would take, you know, from my house. Oh, yes, I've heard of those. I heard that trumpet again. Why do you need the iTunes cards? Are you looking for some new music for this Christmas or what? Securities. Well, what does the iTunes card have to do with security? Zip code? I don't have an iTunes card, but I can give you my zip code. It's 3-3-1-1-4. What kind of music are you going to listen to? I don't understand. All right, so I need two iTunes cards for $100 each. What is the 27 store? I'm not too sure about that. I don't have any cash. I'd have to ask my daughter Nina to come pick me up. I'm 81 years old. I can hardly move out of this couch. Nina does all my bills, I told the previous technician that she keeps a notepad on my computer with all of the information, but I don't have that right now. Because there's a password on my computer, but if I knew this password and I could get back onto my desktop, I would have my bank account, and I would also have my credit card. I'm sorry. I mean, she lives somewhere, I would say, 30 minutes away from me. That's a long time. No, I'm saying my daughter lives about 30 minutes from here, and it's 1.30 in the morning. Am I supposed to wake her up? Do you accept anything else, like in terms of coupons or gift baskets? You know, I've come to think of it, I might have a Subway gift card that my grandson gave me. I usually take them with Nina to Subway, and they like to get that, what is it? The meatloaf football sandwich. What about my Macy's card? I could give you my Macy's card. Oh, you know what? I think I got Tyler something for Christmas. I did buy Tyler a Bitcoin for Christmas. I don't really understand what it is. It's the iTunes, and you really want to listen to those tunes, huh? And what, I just call you back? Oh, can I be your girlfriend? I don't know. You don't know? I don't know. Okay, you can have it. No, I don't want to. You're not allowed to have it. Big deal. Yeah, let her have all the buddies. Everything about her stays stays. Okay, you can have her if you want. Let her have all the buddies. Okay, you can have her if you want. Okay, you can have her if you want. Okay, you can have her if you want. Okay, you can have her if you want. Okay, you can have her if you want. Okay, you can have her if you want. Okay, you can have her if you want. Okay, you can have her if you want. Okay, you can have her if you want. Okay, you can have her if you want. Okay, you can have her if you",
