Now, there are legal enforcement agencies involved in this case, so before we go ahead and give out the complete information to you, I need you to verify me with the last four-digit number of your Social Security, so I can confirm that the details are given to the right person. Mr. Stevens, I'm not asking you to confirm me your Social Security number. What I'm asking you, just to verify me with the last four digits of your Social Security, so I can confirm that the details are given to the right person.

I need to give them the details. Can you just tell me how many bank accounts do you own, as per your knowledge and information? And you told my officer that you want to speak to a senior officer, correct? Go ahead and let me know how many bank accounts are originally owned by you, having to do with illegal activities. See, if you do not tell me how many bank accounts you have, we will go ahead and suspend all the bank accounts which are connected to your Social Security. So don't blame us if you lose any money. We are trying to help you out over here. Right now there are two criminal charges against you. Number one, drug trafficking, and number two, money laundering.",
