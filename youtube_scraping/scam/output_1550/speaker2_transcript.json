  "transcript": "Uh, is there someone who could help me with a strange invoice about a balance board, waist twisting board, yoga fitness, Pilates stability disc, anti-skid training balance, gym board, exercise workout equipment charge that I got for $563.42? Okay, and what was the product's name again? I'll offer $80, that's the most I'm going to pay for that product. Take it or leave it. Okay, so what do you mean? Why do I have to log in there? What are you doing ma'am? I just wanted to verify. Significantly overcharged for this product. I don't see. I don't see any products for the $500. I'm going to give it to America because I'm spoofing their demo and I don't know if we can both use it. I think I might need to restart my computer. Don't. I'm going. Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and just go ahead and restart it quick because it says work securely again. I think there might be a problem. I don't want to buy a balance board, weight lifting, yoga board, fitness, Pilates, yada yada, workout, four in three, never worn, cloud saving, Bluetooth enabled, bind on, pick up, plus three resistance to undead exercise equipment. You know? It literally says it's an online. He's showing it to me. Yes. Scammers will temporarily edit the HTML of your bank just to trick you. Yes, this looks like my bank. I don't want to fill out another. So you can see he's just editing the HTML right in front of me. Not even bothering to hide. Oh. Hmm, nickname. Ah, God, we need a good one. We need a good nickname. Mother Toad? I like that. I like toads. Did you say something? The dude's fuming over there. Heart rate going up. Breathing rate increasing. $3,070 and 14 pennies. Nickels and four pennies. Okay, so you can see because of the transparency, normally the screen wouldn't be transparent. So everything he's doing would be hidden. They sent money in between my bank accounts and they're just editing the HTML kind of like he did a minute ago. To say online transfer from Bank of America. He's actually editing the wrong spot. Um, but the idea is that I technically would have $6,000 in my own account. You didn't have to send that much. $6,000. I thought you were going to send $600. $600. We should talk to Rob. Okay, but in the words of Shaggy, it wasn't me. Okay, let's round it off to an even $5,000. Yeah, a ton of them. Food Lion. Kroger. Piggly Wiggly. Whirl Foods. Apple. Whirl Foods. Apple. Yep. Why, do you want to meet me there? Oh, congratulations. You can return our money. Yeah, I mean I can go to CVS, it's just... That one's only rated one stuff. I'll go to, yeah, I'll go to CVS. Sorry, can you quiet down a little bit? Can you quiet down, but also talk loudly? Okay. Okay. One more minute or so. I'm just in the parking lot. Okay. Be able to get apples, too. Watch where you're going. Go ahead. What? Do you see the apples? I sent you a picture. Right, yeah, they... The manager said that there might be, you know, there's probably 2,000 if I were to get a couple crates. Is this Victor? Oh, I'm at my house. They're called Google. They seem perfect for the situation. I asked one of the people that work there. And who works at the PayPal store, right? With the... Because I wanted to get the balance board, waist-twisting board, fitness disc, anti-grab... Exercise equipment. Yeah, I was just watching. There was a little video about how to do it. It says that you have to redeem it. Let me see if this will work. Let me know if this will go through. It looks like 500 went through. This is how you do it, right? I watched the video. Let me get the next one for you. I don't mind doing this stuff either because, you know, I'm not going to get paid for it. I don't mind doing this stuff either because, you know, I like to make sure everyone gets fair is fair. You know? And you accidentally said... Oh, okay. Do you need to check it? I didn't give you these two yet. Did you want to do it yourself? Sure. Sorry, hold on. You remind me of my grandson. He likes to click things too. Alright, you can click the redeem button. It's kind of hard to hear what you're saying. I'm sorry. I can't hear you. Excel the card that I just sent to you. There's the last one. Okay, what's wrong? I know that guy sent me $6,000. It is a pretty big... It makes mistakes sometimes. It's part of being human. Us are perfect. I left one card for them to try on their computer. Oh, it doesn't work. And then I'll say, oh, I typed it wrong. It's not a B. It's an 8 or whatever. And then I'll redeem it. Okay, so the last card, do you need me to send that to you? I know I still owe you a little bit more money. I can get that to you maybe tomorrow or Friday. They're now connected on three different computers. And they just don't know what's going on. I think they're all just sort of stunned. They've got three computers connected to me, trying to figure out why they can't control my screen. I don't know if they're just like lost hope. They're just huddling in silence. Oh, you know what? I gave you the wrong... Hold on. It's P, J, O, 8. Okay. I sent you the last one. I can't hear you if you're talking to me or not. I'll text you. Yesterday I was in the middle of... Yeah, I told you I would call you. So I wanted... Because I don't want you to miss out on the $4,000. I don't want you to miss out on the $4,000. But my grandson said normally you don't buy... You normally don't pay people gift cards. All right, let me head to my house. And on the way I'll get some cards. Hi, it's Cheryl Andrews. I got the cards that you asked for. Is that right? Okay, I just felt so bad. I didn't want you to lose your job. I went to the store to get it for you. Did you get it? I'm not... I'm not wasting your time. I'm just trying to give you the cards. I don't want you to get in trouble. I'm just trying to give you the cards. I don't want you to get in trouble. Will that work? Can you send them? Oh, little... Little baby. I'm just going to write... Oops. Honest mistake. Wrong picture. He didn't text me back. Or answer my phone calls. It's understandable because I wasted a bunch of their time and made them pretty angry. Hopefully you had a chance to laugh and learn a few things as you watched the video. And as always, know that you're valuable and you matter. I hope you have a chance to pursue something that you find meaningful or something you're passionate about this week. I'll see you in the next video.",
