  "transcript": "This is a criminal case registered under your name for tax fraud and tax evasion and there is also a warrant out for your arrest now. This is a recordable line sir, I have to play this recording in the court house so we don't need any interruption. Yeah, the recording is going to be played in the court house. We found out a miscalculation of £1,693 outstanding under your name. So at this point of time we have only two options. Your first option is to go to court and fight the case. In case if you are found guilty you have to pay a penalty fine of £19,000 and an imprisonment of two years. And if you want to resolve the matter outside of the court house then you have to pay the outstanding amount which is £1,693 to the government. If at this point it was not your intention to defraud the HMRC then this whole money is going to be refunded back to you. What do you want to do? You want to go to court or you want to pay and resolve the matter? Sir, over to the recordable line because I have to submit this recording to the court house and law is not according to you. You have to go over the law. So you have to come from the department. What do you want to do? If you want to go to court you can simply hang up the call and wait for police. They will come to you and they will take you in custody. Sorry. If you are found guilty you have to pay the outstanding amount and the penalty fine of £19,000 and if you want to resolve the matter you just need to pay £1,693 to the government. So you have to do it online by yourself. We can only give you the transaction code of the court house so you can pay directly to the court house. Do you have these funds available to resolve the matter? Which bank you are banking with sir? HSBC. Apart from HSBC do you have any other bank account like Revolut, Monzo, Monis or any other bank?
