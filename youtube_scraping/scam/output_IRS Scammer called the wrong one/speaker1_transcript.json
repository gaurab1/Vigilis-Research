  "transcript": "Criminal Investigation Division of IRS. How may I help you? I'm looking for Mr. Cole White. Hello, sir. How are you doing today? Sir, my name is Michael Jennings from Criminal Investigation Division of IRS. The reason behind my call is to inform you that we received an arrest to warrant case file under your name. So did you receive any phone call from your local police department till now? Are you trying to say you have not been aware about the situation happening under your name? Alright, Mr. Cole, in that case, I want you to grab a pen and a piece of paper so that you can write down some information. Are you ready? First of all, let me start with the case ID. It starts with C as in Charlie. K as in Kevin. 846042. Yes. And your warrant identification number starts with 00. 100-3636. And you're talking to Officer Michael Jennings. And my badge ID number starts with J as in Jack. M as in Mary. Number 7792. Now, you don't have to write down anything. You just have to listen to me carefully so that it will be easier for you to understand what is this all about, okay? First of all, this is a three-way conference call with the Department of Homeland Security. So whatever you speak or comment, that should be true and honest because this phone recording can be serving in front of the Bar Council of your state to prove you innocent or guilty. Is that been okay, Mr. Cole? Now, Mr. Cole, you have been found suspicious and breaching three important laws of the United States. Count 1, violation of Internal Revenue Services Act, 1956. Count 2, violation of Federal Tax Rules and Regulations Act, 1989. Count 3, providing misleading information to the government authorities. Now, I had a question for you, Mr. Cole. Who is filing your taxes? You yourself or do you have a public accountant? How long you have been using accountant service? About seven years. All right. Now, proceeding further, the IRS has conducted an audit, a random audit on your last five-year tax file papers, and they found that there are lots of errors in 1040-A form, 941-C form, and Schedule H form. And because of those errors, there is a miscalculated tax amount pending under your name, which you still owe to the government, to the IRS Department. I had a question for you, like a very few legal questions which you need to answer, mean yes or no. The first question is like, have you ever been arrested before by any state police or any sheriff department? Have you ever been filed bankruptcy or a foreclosure in the past? Have you ever been issued any tickets by the traffic police? Are there judgments still pending under your name? Are there any judgments still pending under your name? No. I believe that you have answered all my questions with utmost honesty. Now, proceeding further, to give you such limited information, which I believe I already did. Now, at this moment of time, you've got two options left from our side. The first option you've got, that is you can fight this case against the government in the court by hiring a tax attorney. And the second option you've got, that is you can simply resolve this case, you can sort this out today, outside the court, by making the payments back to the IRS Department. So, what is your... So, the IRS, on the records of the IRS, it seems like that you owe $2,997 at this moment of time. So, what are you going to do with this payment? First of all, I have to be sure that you really want to make this payment. Because, sir, as you understand, I am not forcing you to decide anything. It's just you only, you have to decide it from your end, whether you want to resolve the case or whether you want to proceed further with the legal stuff. Okay, no problem. Now, it is not so easy in order to make these payments and in order to resolve the case. Because you have to understand what are the privacy laws which you are getting at this moment in order to resolve the case. And that you have to, you know, proceed with that. Payment procedures and all. So, the privacy laws which we have at this moment is... The first question and the first thing which I need to tell you that is... Do not disconnect or hang up this line until and unless the resolvement is not been proposed. Okay? The second is, you cannot put me on a mute or hold for this case. The second is, you cannot put me on a mute or hold for this case. As this is a three-way conference call and all the senior persons are listening to the conversation. And in order to make this payment, first of all, I have to ask you, do you have a sufficient balance available with you? $2,997? You can make this payment by using a taxpayee card. Do you know what is called taxpayee card? No, sir. A taxpayee card, you can get it from any of your supermarket store, any grocery store or any kind of, you know, departmental store. Do you have any such store available near to you? Okay, what kind of supermarkets are available near to you? What is the name? Okay. And what kind of departmental stores are there near to you? I'm sorry? I'm sorry? Do you have, like, any kind of TurboTax store or any kind of that? Okay. What I'll do is I'll be collecting you to my accounts division officer so that you can take care of this issue from his side, okay? Kindly hold the line, okay? Okay. Sir, it seems like there is some problem with the accounts division and so I'll be the person who will be informing you all this stuff, okay? Alright. That's correct. It's 425 South Adams Street, Suite 202, Green Bay. 4301. You're working with White Law Offices, right? Correct. Okay. So you are an attorney, by the way? Okay. And how long you have been in this profession, by the way? Okay. Oh. And who is filing your taxes, by the way? You yourself or do you have an accountant? Okay. Then in that case, you had an option. If you are an attorney, you can fight this case against the government. That would be a good option for you. How about that? Okay. I've given you, sir. That is the badge ID number, sir. That is the IRS Federal ID number, sir. It is. You can search it down. I'm sorry? Virginia? That's Virginia, by the way? Yes. Okay. Virginia? That's Virginia, by the way? Vienna? Too long. Okay. I don't think I have to give you the examination or something like that. Nobody can ask me that kind of questions. Now, if you are a legal representative or whoever you are, then do one thing. Wait for the legal consequences once it will be appearing on your name. Then it would be fine that you can ask me legal questions. But at this moment, you are nobody who can ask me or you are nobody who can tell me about this kind of questions. Okay. Send your penis to your mom. That would be worth it. How about that?",
