  "transcript": "Yes, I received a call from somebody from this number saying that I needed to give them a call back from the IRS. This is. I'm fine, I'm just trying to get to the, figure out what's going on. Okay, yeah, I haven't yet. What's going on? I'm not aware of anything. Please tell me what's happening. What's going on? Absolutely. I'm ready. Okay, see. Okay. Okay. 8-4-6-0-4-2. Okay. 1-0-0. 3-6-3-6. Michael Jennings, okay. 7-7-9-2. Okay. All right. First. Yes, absolutely. Okay. Okay. I use an accounting service. How long have you been in this business? About seven years. Okay. Okay. Oh God, no. No. Well, certainly. Okay. I'm sorry, I didn't understand the question. Well, how much are you saying that I owe? How much is the miscalculation? I see. Oh man, that's really serious. Jeez, but I bet you that's less than having to pay an attorney and all of that. How would I go about paying that then just to get this taken care of? Okay. No, the legal stuff sounds really scary. I don't want to deal with all that. I would rather just get it taken care of. I don't want to be in any kind of trouble. Okay. Okay. I see, okay. Oh yes, absolutely. All right. No, is that like a credit card? I believe I'd be able to go to a supermarket nearby and get one of those. I believe there's a super value or a pick and save nearby. Like the mall, is that what you mean? I'm not sure exactly what this card is. I could certainly go there. I want to do whatever's necessary to get this taken care of. I certainly don't want to be in any trouble with the government. Maybe. I really don't know. I've never been in this situation before. Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. So at this point, this is kind of obviously a bunch of bullshit, right? I put him on mute. So if this really is an IRS guy, I'm in trouble. But we'll see. I'm on hold right now waiting for Department of Homeland Security agent Big Dick from India to get on the line and try to take my money from me. Let's see how this goes. Okay. Yes. That's right. Yep. That's correct. Okay. I am. I'm in fact a criminal defense attorney and deal with tax issues all the time. Oh, I've been up here at this office for almost four years now. So, you know, I was really surprised to get this call. You know, given my history in working with the IRS, it's really, really surprising. No, I have an accountant that deals with my taxes. And, you know, we've always filed and everything's always worked out okay. So this call is pretty surprising, you know, as an attorney and in good standing with our state bar and having worked with the IRS on tax issues in the past for other clients. This is really unusual. And I'm really surprised because the IRS never calls people. I yeah. You know, as I think about it, that may make a lot of sense. Officer Jennings, what is your IRS ID number? Are you waiting, Jack? You gave me a badge number. JM 7792. That's not that's not a federal identification number, though. That's that's not a that's not an IRS federal ID number. It isn't, though. Yeah, it really. It really, really isn't, though. Where were you? Where were you born, Mike? Where were you born, Mr. Jennings? We're in Virginia. Vienna, Virginia. Yeah. How far is that from Arlington? I'm sorry. How far is that from Arlington? Too long. What school did you go to? Well, actually, I am as an attorney, and you're talking to me now and engaging in a legal discussion. I think I'm entitled to. OK, why don't you give me a mailing address so I can send you a subpoena so I can answer the ask you these questions, OK? I need a mailing address for your IRS location so that I can send a subpoena so I can depose you, Mr. Jennings. Send my subpoena to my mom. That's very unprofessional for an IRS investigator. Aw, Mike? Did I lose you, Mike? Aw.",
