  "transcript": "Do you guys just send me a check, or how does it work? How do I get that payment from you? But I ordered a sit-down one. We're talking about a lawnmower, right? I'm confused. You said I was getting a stand-up, you said something about a standing-up, but I ordered a sit-down, it's a ride-on lawnmower, it's one of those that you sit on, I don't want to stand on it, it's one of those where you sit on the lawnmower and you can mow your lawn back and forth while you're sitting on it, and you drive it forward, am I not understanding? It's a little weird that, because I ordered it, I ordered it like nine days ago, I mean I was told it was like four to seven day shipping, so I mean I want to resolve it, and I'm not sure what it's going to take to do that or what you need from me, I thought it was paid for already, it's supposed to come in a pretty large box, and I never got a box, I'm sitting here at the apartment, I called my girlfriend and she said no, maybe you should go wash your hands, it's not here, so I'm not, I don't know what you need from me, but I can't, I don't want to freak out my dog if they show up to my house, I'm not here, the dog will be scared, and he might eat up the box, and then my lawnmower won't function. You asked me, well it's the model number, right, I mean I ordered the burgundy one, I told the other, almost there, I'm walking up to the door, one second, a Target gift card, okay, I got the cards, I am too cute? You have my picture, you said I was cute, I'm not cute at all, I am a fast deporter, now forgive me, I'm a little bit massively dyslexic, so I have to go slow, let me find a coin or something really quick, hang on one second, okay, it's nine, eight, sorry, oh my gosh, I'm so allergic to something in this Target, it must be all the bullshit, no it wasn't four, it was five, seven, seven, six, six, not four, one, five, seven, six, six, three, four, seven, eight, nine, eight, five, seven, no, and then it's nine, eight, five, seven, no, and then there's a nine, eight, five, seven, that's what's on the bottom of the basket, it's on the barcode. I had to buy a lot of them because you said you wanted a Target gift bag, right, and they come with these gift bags at the front. To get $3,400 worth, I had to buy like 2,000 of them. Is that going to work? Well, you said you wanted a Target gift bag, Target gift car, well, they don't gift cars, gift bags, they're like, they're baskets and they have shampoo and candle, it's really pretty. I could send you a picture if you want. You know what else I could do? I could hang up this call, I could hang up this call because you are an inbred mother piece of, scamming people, stupid, dumb son of a, that I wasted minutes of your time so you can't scam other people, you horrible mother, how dare you, you should be ashamed. How dare you scam people, go get a real, awful strong words for someone working for the IRS, Target gift cards, are you kidding me? You can't think of something more convincing than for me to pay off my IRS debt with a Target gift card, you're so f***ing stupid. Have a dog, have relations with my dog, that's f***ing awesome. Oh, Pakistan's where you're calling from. This is what's wrong with the, this is what's wrong, this is what's wrong with, I'm glad that was 39 less minutes you could use to scam some, you are stealing money from innocent people who are gullible, and that is despicable, that is despicable, that you would go and steal money from old people, from innocent people, from gullible people, you're a piece of s*** for it, and I really hope you find what it is that makes you happy, I hope you find what it is, I hope you get redemption, because when you meet God at the pearly gates of heaven, you're going to have to answer to this, and I wish I could watch.",
