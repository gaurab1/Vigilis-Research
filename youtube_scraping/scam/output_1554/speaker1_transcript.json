Okay, do I know your manager, what are they like? Okay, then I'm inside the house. Oh, thank goodness. Okay, so it's four, three, two, five. Deblanahurst, circling, I'll lay on the dorsets. Pablano, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'll tell you the city in a second. It's lighting something. I'm sorry, the kitchen's pretty par right now. So you want the city that I live in? Are you not worried about my- No, she's still on fire. Sorry, are you, are you working on the hour or do you work commission? Hardly, that's what I thought. My daughter is still on fire. No, there are still flames of fire and- They gave me a call though. Do you have short term memory loss? My mom has short term memory loss. Hi there, my name is Diana and I'm looking forward to flying to Bermuda. It's for six passengers, sorry. Adults? All kids, except me. There is no number between 12 and 11. Kids are 7 years old. Um, can I pay cash? Pfft. Okay. Hi there, Tiana, my name is Diana, my last name is Ruby. Yes, that's my name. Do not. Okay. Can I use it at a Cracker Barrel? This cannot be a joke. Because I have to use this for my children. This comments are random because I just need this to be here before that episode. Do you think that I'll be able to, uh, occur? Okay, perfect. I'm sorry, did you understand what I said? Okay, so you want, um, the Visa? Oh, but y'all don't take Amex, don't you? Did someone just scream? I'm sure there isn't a kiddo in there. Well, here, let me grab my MasterCard. Fly. Septims. Six and two. Eps. Nines. I beg your pardon? It is 3383. Who was that? Who? I love your laugh, Tian. Is that the laugh you do when you scam people for hundreds of dollars? And when she grows up to find out, Tian. Obviously, you're no fit to be a mother. She grows up. I have six kids and they're all in their bedrooms in their queen-sized beds because I make a living for them and how do you get sleep at night? Well, you act like one, too. So, the rest of the card? Oh, there she is. Huh, baby? She'll probably watch this video when she grows up. Congratulations, you're the star. Say hi to everyone. I just find it funny that you're using your time Southern mom, who has nothing better to do I think you're some diva. I thought you ate with that one, but the only thing you're eating is the restraining order that is about to be shoved down your throat. Had enough fun, you suck. Okay. I've never had a conversation with a scammer like that before. Her admitting she's not a diva. Is this the financial relief phone? Both. 930 Please don't be judgmental. I'm really embarrassed. Okay. Look at my credit report. That's private. I was just expecting to feel relief, but that scared me. But I would rather the money relieve me. Sorry, bad joke. Okay. Another joke, sorry. What's your name again? Said McMichael. Thank you. The last four of my social media is I feel pretty secure. That was so stupid. Is this due reservations for airlines? Okay, which airlines? Which one is the best airline for the United States? Okay. Do a Delta flight from Los Angeles to Atlanta, Georgia. We do first class for these flights, so I'll do first class. What? Okay, I've made a third virtual. Times a charm. Let's see if I can piss them off. I got them to swear. Guys, I just stole Diana Diamond's Christmas present.
