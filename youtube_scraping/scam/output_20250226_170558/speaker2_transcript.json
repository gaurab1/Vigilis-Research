  "transcript": "I called him. Thank you. Oh, shot. I keep getting messages on the computer that says my PC's in danger. I tried to register. That way my PC wouldn't be in danger anymore. A lot of viruses, I think. Problem? The past six months. I don't know what the heck this thing is. I try to close it out, and it just keeps popping up more. Don't know what the heck that is. I'm just trying to... I usually just move them, you know, off the screen. Okay, yeah, I'll let you take care of it since you're the expert. Oh, I forgot I upgraded my computer with more cores. Oh, God. It's not the hacker known as 4chan, is it? What is this? Bonzi, the Intelligent Interactive Traveling Companion, for the World Wide Web. He helps me traverse through the internet. How long have you been working on computers? Let me show you. Where did you come up with that number, because that's not the number on the screen. Computer. Oh, God. Computer. No, I have corn outside, though. Corn. Corn. I didn't notice, but he uploaded corn to my computer. Really? For scientific research purposes, can you... Where are they? Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Corn. Where are they? Good heavens. Do you see? Tiny little computer. God Almighty. How did you put those on there? He claimed that hackers uploaded it and that I had to pay a bunch of money for security. Computer. I promise to you. Uh-oh. That's a little bit of a problem. What? Just fake pop-ups? I don't know. Can I just close? Yeah, just close out. Just close out of those real quick. How are you going to do that? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know how. No, I don't. I don't know how. This guy was so desperate, he gave me his company's name and wire information, which I obviously reported to bank fraud professionals. Quick question for you. Why did you upload pornography to my computer? I mean, it very specifically says in the chat log that it says certified tech created the... Oh, don't scroll down. Certified tech created the directory, see user's personal documents, porn. And then I started receiving a bunch of files. Well, I mean, it says that you did it. Why did you upload pornography to my computer? It says you did, right there. It says certified tech created the directory. You see that? Oh, you hung up already? I decided to add a few more viruses for good measure and call another scammer. How did she become a pop star? Is my computer running slow? Well, heck yes it is! And I'll click them, but they never seem to fix the problem. Viruses! ...terrible things... Alright? I'm actually a little surprised he could even use the computer. It's very slow. I think it's Windows, I'm not sure though. ...this... ...an email... ...it's... Oh, Nagoosh wants to hog! What problems are they, exactly? He's going through the script. But there's actual malware living on the computer. He's just lying about it. Stop. The reason that I'm having so many problems with the computer is because some of the drivers are stopped. I'm a fast learner. Drivers might be stopped, but this brain isn't stopped, buddy. ...turned off... ...with the... ...says there are no reports. The computer is just fine. Okay, gotta start the drivers. Never mind. ...piñata that... Uh-oh. Are you an idiot? No. Alright. I think you... Ma'am? What? Ma'am, I... Uh... No, I would never call you an idiot! That just came up on the computer! I think it might be the malware! He won't be able to turn them off. Like, he's... it's just... I'm not going to be able to fill out his little form that he wants me to fill out. ...kind of clear up. Just get some of this sorted out. That way we can focus on the... ...name on... You're just going to plow her through it? Dude, is this normal? I think I gotta think about it. ...call us back. Thank you. I feel like you might have lied a little bit. Is it? Ma'am, you... ...don't have anything to do with it. It's this... 200 malware files that I downloaded. Not the drivers. Why'd you say the drivers? I had a ton of fun with this video and a few ideas for what I could do next. But I would love to hear from you. What viruses, what chaos can I bring to these scammers? Let me know in the comments. And if you enjoyed the video or learned a few things, share it with a friend. As always, know that you are valuable and you matter. And I will see you in the next video. Bye!",
