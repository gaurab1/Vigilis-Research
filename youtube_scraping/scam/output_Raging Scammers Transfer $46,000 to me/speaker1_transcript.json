Diolch yn fawr am wylio'r fideo. Awas a raha he! Rydych chi i gyd wedi cael gwaith. Dw i eisiau siarad â Saqib. Dwi eisiau siarad â Saqib. Dwi eisiau siarad â Saqib. Dwi'n gwybod bod e yma. Beth yw 68 Udkar Mithra? Beth yw 68 Udkar Mithra? Beth yw 68 Udkar Mithra? Beth yw 68 Udkar Mithra? Beth yw 68 Udkar Mithra? Yeah, guys like you in Sector 5... Hey, did you know that... Hey, did... Did you know... Hey, did you know that... Hey, did you know that there was another... Did you know there was... Police arrest a main man behind a fake call center racket in Salt Lake Sector 5. Hey, when you talk to me, son, you put some respect on this name. Do you hear me, son? You put some respect on this name. Hey, you put... No, they're not going to do it anymore because we're going to keep exposing. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, come on, Sakim. That's all you have? That's all you got? It's you. I know it's you. I know it's you, Sakim. I know it's you. Hey, ab tamiz sebat karo. Do you hear me? Ab tamiz sebat karo. Ab tamiz sebat karo. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? Ab tamiz sebat karo. Do you understand me, son? Oh, that's all you can say is abusive terms. Come on. Talk to me like a man. Come on, talk to me like a man. Talk to me like a man. Talk to me like a man. Talk to me. Talk to me like a man, little boy. Yeah. Oh, you are? That's how a man talks? That's... Oh, because it's you. I don't have to look anywhere because I'm talking to Sakim. Ab tamiz sebat karo when you talk to me. You understand. You understand what I'm saying. You understand what I'm saying. But you understand what I'm saying. You understand what I'm saying, though. If you put the video... Yes, Sakim. Oh, yes, Sakim. Oh, they will know what you're saying, Sakim. I understand, Sakim. It's already on YouTube, Sakim. It's already on YouTube, Sakim. Do you have anybody else that you want me to expose? Do you have any family members you want me to, like, tell everyone that you're a scammer and you're stealing from people? Hey, we have another big Kolkata boss that we're exposing very soon. You know that, right? Yeah, I know. I'm not talking to a real man. I'm not talking to a real man. All right, go ahead, Sakim. Sakim. Done. Nice. That's all you've got? And then he's going to hang up. Sakim. They don't like when you speak Hindi to them at all. He doesn't like that we knew his name. And then third, he doesn't like that we wasted his time for so long. That guy hasn't stolen $22,000 from anybody, don't worry. Oh, he's back on. He's back on my computer. He got back on my IndieDesk or on my TeamViewer. I hide the icons, guarantee you. This is like Scammer 101. They're going to go and hide the icons. Delete my files. Delete them. Delete my files, Scammer. And then they're like, we knew the whole time. Oh, yeah, we knew. Well, no, you knew when we played the freaking Scammer Payback song. He's so honored to be on the Scammer Payback VM right now. He's probably shaking. He's so honored. So much money is rolling in, in the middle of the day, that they're worried about going on my VM and deleting my files. That's what he's worried about. Look, he doesn't even know what he's doing. Let's watch a Scammer try to delete a Scambaiter's files. Hey, try to delete my files. He doesn't even know what he's doing. He's now gone on. He's made it so I can't click around on the screen. You showed me. Take the icons away. Please take them away. Yes! This is 100% what Scammers do. This makes me so happy. The only thing he can do, he tried to delete all the icons, but he selected the recycle bin. If he had just not selected the recycle bin, he could have deleted everything. This is so embarrassing. I would be so embarrassed. I know you guys are watching, Saqib, and all your friends, y'all are in Kolkata. So bad. To our members and Patreon family for helping us go against these Scammers every single day. If you want to consider joining the fight, we'd really appreciate that. Scammer Payback, saying don't get scammed. Scammer Payback",
