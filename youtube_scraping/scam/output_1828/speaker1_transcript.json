I don't check too often and I've been thinking about doing something like this for a while. It's like arts and crafts for for old men. Look at these. That looks like a real winner right there. You know, I've been thinking about getting. I've been trying to start my own. My own little fishing business, and I thought I'd take my take the guys out, you know, I'd say I got to learn. I got the rods. I got the boat. I can take him on my banana taxi. I get 12 fishing poles and a lot. But it's guaranteed to get a fish. Calculate it really quick, because $1,800. I could make that in a day. You know, we could do a little bit of trolling. Sure. I think I'll buy. Yeah, yeah. Can you hear me? What's wrong? I'm kind of in the middle of something. 112 pounds of thrust for $3,600. Now, that's a lot. Oh, sorry. Hold on. Clicking all over the place. Okay. Hey, listen, thank you for sending me the money. It was nice to meet you. You have a good rest of your day. And again, you call me. You want to go fishing? You call me. 4K HD camera diving, shooting, search and rescue. We'll have film night, ROV, drone, marine video, fish fighter. Thank you. Thank you. Now I'm done. Go ahead. I can see if, sometimes if you close it and open it up. My name's not Terry Bango Bowl. Yes, please. Yes, please. By the way. Complete T-style dock package. Normal. I'm starting. I'm going to go fishing. What else do you do as a doc? Okay. You said just give me two minutes. I always buy a little bit of silver. A hundred thousand dollars. My son, he's about to turn 25. And he's getting married this summer. He's getting married this month, at the end of the month. And I was thinking, you know, when I got married, my grandfather gave me a silver dollar. And so I was thinking of getting him one of these. You can keep it in your pocket just in case you ever need it. For my son. Oh, shoot. Right? Yeah, I'm going to need it. Well, it's not just any silver coin. That's an Illinois cent right there. That was once $1, you know. It's an investment opportunity. Okay. I got a price. I got a price check this tarp. Oh, sorry. I just want to make sure I don't forget a tarp for my boat. Okay. Listen, all I know is my iPad says I got $7,900 in my checking. And I don't know what's going on. Tell me about it. Are you there? Yes. I'm trying to figure out what I'm supposed to be doing. Me out there? Unaccountable. Yeah. How did you know that? Can you see me? Yeah. I'm sorry. They didn't have any vanilla flavored cards, like you said. They just had vanilla. Google card. Is that what you're talking about? You know, on the back, it says open the Play Store. Scratch the label off. It says P. It has instructions on the back. I don't know if this is what you're supposed to do or not. I know my grandson uses Google. So how does it work? Do you have a hunch about how we're going to take care of the rest of the money? Or are you okay if I buy a boat tarp? Yeah. Yeah, but if I don't have a boat tarp, what happens to my boat? I'll tell you. Are you sure? I mean, I don't have to get... Buy the $7,000 one. It's just I need something. I don't want to lose my... Yeah. Huh? Well, it's hard because some of these cards, the numbers are hard to... The numbers in our letters, they look the same, you know? Is there a way to check? How do you know whether there's money on there or not? Uh, okay. I'm going to check it to make sure it's working here. Oh, you know what, sir? Okay, so it's... I can't tell if it's an A or a B. The Hs and the Bs look the same. Okay, so it says you are... Okay. There's money on it. I think there's money on it. Okay. Some of them are on. I wonder if we're going to have the same problem here. I don't know. Let me check. Let me see if I... Let me make sure there's money on it before you guys waste too much of your time. I definitely think this last one is an A, not a B, though. No. What was that? What? You want as well? No. Let me make sure the third card works as well. Yeah, I'm tracking with you. Okay. This last card, though. Let me see if this one... Oh, yeah. $5,000. $5,000. I mean, I can give it a shot. If not, I'd be willing to buy this $5,000 thick camping tarp with grime in it. I could send it your way. But if you'd rather me do the wire, I can give that a shot. No. If you want, I can do two $2,500 tarps. No. $2,500 tarps. I... $2,500. I don't... How many employees... I'm going to go grab a bite to eat, but I promise I'll take care of it tomorrow. So... Okay. Okay, bye. The last time. Call me tomorrow. No. You, you mother... Sorry, I think you got the wrong number, son. I think you got the wrong number, son. You got the wrong... You... Bye.",
