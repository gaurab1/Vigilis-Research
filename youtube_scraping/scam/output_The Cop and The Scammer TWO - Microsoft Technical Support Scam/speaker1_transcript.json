  "transcript": "Okay, I think I can hear you now. What was that? Now, who did you say you're with again? No! No! Okay, all right! I appreciate that! That's really kind of y'all to reach out to me and let me know, Microsoft has some great customer support. Yes, it is. Uh, I've got a, I've got a slide show up. A slide show up. Senior technician? Okay, all right. Okay, so I've muted it. Basically, what's happening is I've received a call claiming to be from Microsoft technical support saying that they have identified malicious software on my computer and because they have such great customer support, they're reaching out to me to fix it. What will happen is they'll come back on and they'll tell me that they need to remote access into my computer in order to fix this. Oh, well, we'll go along for the ride a little bit. See how long we can keep. Oh, I'm doing well, Ryan. Um, my, my slide show. I've used that key before. Windows and R. It pulled up a little, I don't know, it says run and open. Yes, it sure is. Uh, event. As in Victoria. Okay. Well, nothing, nothing happened. I don't know what I did wrong. I don't, I don't know what I did wrong. I must have, I thought I had it right. Hey, you know what? It probably, you know what it probably could be. It could be that I don't even use a Windows computer. I use a Mac and you've called a police officer because you're a scammer and you're trying to remote into my computer. That could be the problem. Is that what I did wrong? Oh, okay. All right. Thank you. What's the problem? Well, I told you, uh, I think the problem is that I use a Mac computer, uh, not, not anything with windows on it and I'm a police officer. Now, again, now these guys weren't willing to, these guys weren't willing to give up as much information as the last video I did. However, you saw what they wanted me to do is this box that was pulled up here. This is a command prompt. Okay. And basically, uh, what they wanted me to do is enter in a command that would allow them to then gain access to my computer remotely because they are technical support in which I'm basically opening up the door for them to get in there and mess around. They'll say that they're fixing stuff, but what they're really doing is taking sensitive information, installing malicious software. This is another common scam. Unfortunately, a lot of people fall for it. There were a couple of red flags. Number one, the window, I mean the, uh, the number that came up, it was a very strange number. You see it has plus 61 space 2339. It just doesn't look right. If you get a number that shows up on your phone that just doesn't look right, that, that could be flag number one. Um, number two, they immediately told me they've identified problems, but they didn't even verify who I was or, or whether or not I had the computer. It just doesn't work that way. And Microsoft will not reach out to you if you do have a problem. That's not the way that their support system works. Okay. Um, so once again, thankfully we didn't fall for this. I hope you enjoyed the video. I hope you learned something. Share it with those that you love, especially those people that may not be very familiar with computers or around computers. Spread this, let them know about the scam and we'll see you next time. Transcribed by https://otter.ai Transcribed by https://otter.ai",
