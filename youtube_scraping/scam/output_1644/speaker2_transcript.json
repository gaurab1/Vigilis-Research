  "transcript": "May I ask you when was the last time you filed your federal taxes? Okay, so are you an extension? Well, alright. First of all, write down my name. My name is ******. Got it. And the lawsuit has been filed against you by the Internal Revenue Service, so... ...are you aware of the situation what is happening here under your name? Oh, well, alright, now here, I will just go ahead and read out the legal charges against your name. But before I do that, please don't interrupt me in between because... ...this call is federally recorded and monitored by the IRS and by the Homeland Security. And so... Okay, well, I appreciate your opinion. We, the government, have conducted an audit on your taxes filed for the year 2013-2017. And we have found out, yes, and we have found out that... ...there was a miscalculation here on the taxes which you have filed for those five years. The tax record... ...does not match the tax record that we have here. The local authorities with an arrest warrant will come into place. Your driver's license will be cancelled and everything under your name, your properties, and your bank account will be frozen. And also, you could face a federal imprisonment for up to five years. The total amount outstanding on your name is $6,482. So now, on this well-recorded line, may I ask you that did you do this intentionally or was it by mistake? ... There can be a payment plan and relaxation for you. Yeah. ... All right. Yes, please. Yeah. Here. I do understand your concern and your situation in which you are right now. And here, I can see from your files that you are facing this kind of problem for the first time with the IRS, am I right? Yeah. Can you please verify me what your studio CD string number is? Yeah, it's... All right. I will be transferring this call to one of my senior supervisors from the accounts department... ...who will give you further more information about this matter. ... So... So you want to deal with me directly? ... I don't have the authority over you to accept any payments from you or to tell you to undergo through this. Okay. When I transfer you call to one of my senior supervisors, okay? Okay, thank you. Bye-bye. Hasta luego. ...holding the line. Your call has been transferred to the resolution department. So I guess your call has been transferred for the cancellation of this arrest warrant to resolve this situation as you have chosen to resolve this matter out of the courthouse. Is that right? ... ...go ahead, resolve this situation without involving any of your staff department. All right. So... Okay. ...during the past five years, how did you file your taxes? Did you hire somebody else to file your taxes or you filed your taxes with the help of the private companies like the TurboTaxes, H&R Block... ... ...whoa. All right. So is that an accountant? Is that a certified accountant? We, the IRS, we never encourage you to hire somebody else and file your taxes. It's your own responsibility to take care of the situation. But... ... We need to remove your name from this black place. ... ... ... ... I'm sorry? What's up? ... ... I just... I just... I just want to live shorter. I don't want to live all the way till my old age. All right. I'm happy with what I'm doing. Not much. Just enough for my survival. I need... I need... I need to survive. I need to survive. Imagine... Imagine two nineties without food and water. I... ... I'm looking for a better life. Whatever I do, I always mess up. I mess up in everything I do. I've been low so far. I have to change you guys. And I don't know actually what to say, so... The world is full of evil. Karma will hit me back. ...",
