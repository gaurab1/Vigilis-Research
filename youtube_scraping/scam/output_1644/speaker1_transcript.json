  "transcript": "I filed it last year, but I filed it late. I haven't filed my 2017 taxes yet, but I did them last year. But I told my CPA, like, I wanted to do it late because I honestly don't really agree with the whole tax thing. I told them, I mean, like, they may take our lives, but they'll never take our freedom. And so, but he's like, no, you have to do it or you won't have freedom. Yeah, I'm on an extension. I'm on an extension for 2017. He told me that my CPA said that was an option, and I said, you complete me. Let's do it. No, I had, I had no idea there was a lawsuit, but I mean, I drink your milkshake, so fill me in. I promise I definitely won't. I definitely won't interrupt. I'm actually a little bit scared about the situation, but you make me want to be a better man. So I'll be quiet. I'll listen. You tell me what's going on and we can fix this today. Miscalculation. Well, it was definitely a mistake. I mean, I guess I've been a little distracted the last year or so. I mean, because as of January, I mean, I'm just one stomach flu away from my. So I was trying to focus on fitness and I spent a little bit more money on personal training, you know, to the point where I had a home gym put in my house, like my brother would be here and we'd walk in. I'd be like, Chewie, we're home. And he's like, what are you doing? It doesn't make any sense. So I, it was definitely an accident. I don't know how this happened, but that's a lot of money. Do I have to pay all that today? If a payment plan could be arranged, that'd be great, because otherwise I'm not going to be able to eat this month. The only thing I'll be able to afford is it's called like a, they call it a Royale with cheese, but it's just this really cheap kind of sandwich that you can get like 10 for a dollar. And I don't want to do that. It's not fair to me. It's not fair to my llamas. So it may be, if we could, if we could do the, I'm sorry, no, go ahead. There. Okay, well. This has never happened before. It's a, it's a business PO box. It's right, it's right next to, I don't know if you're local, but it's right next to, there's like a, there's like a card detailing place. It's called Wax On, Wax Off. It's right next door to that. Does it have to be transferred? Cause I mean, I could talk to the other guy and I mean, I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse, but I would rather talk to you directly. I can't, cause you seem like a nice guy and I'm a little, I'm a little freaked out cause you know, I had a problem with an IRS agent another time and they got so mad at me. I called in, they didn't even say hello. They just said, Argo yourself, right? And I was like, well, that's not very nice. So I would rather deal with nice people. You seem like a good guy and you, you know, like you seem like you got a good sense of humor and I appreciate a sense of humor. Even my brother said that's the whole reason why he even, you know, he said, I'm funny. I'm like, I mean, I mean, I'm funny. Like I'm a clown. I amuse you. And he's like, well, yeah, kinda. So I'm like, all right. And so we became good friends. So my point was, I just don't know, do I, if I have to deal with someone else or if I can just deal with you, with you directly, well, cause you just seem nice and I just don't like, I'm just, this whole situation kind of, kind of freaks me out. I mean, I already texted my brother. I said, Houston, we have a problem, but he hasn't replied yet. I think he's with a girl. I'm not sure. Okay. That's fine. I'll just keep swimming. You can transfer me and, um, you know, we'll, we'll get this resolved cause I got to get that arrest warrant taken off. Okay. Thank you. La vista, baby. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Yeah, I mean, um, why so serious? I mean, the other guy was just giving me all the information, but, you know, he was kind of working to calm me down because I'm a little freaked out about the situation. But, yeah, I really need this arrest warrant. I've never had an arrest warrant on my name before. Is this, is that, what does that mean? Does that mean they're going to come and get me now? Or is it kind of like, you know, I just have to freak out about it for the rest of my life, like to infinity and beyond, you know? Yeah, well, the dude abides. I definitely hired somebody, and I don't take it lightly, I mean, I am serious, and don't call me Shirley. I hired this guy to do it, and he said that he knew about taxes, but, you know, honestly, for some reason, I couldn't see him. I mean, it was like I see dead people, you know, it was kind of like I walk in, and he just kind of wasn't really there with it, you know, he was just kind of spaced out. Maybe he was on Xanax. I don't know, honestly. But I hired him, and he told me that it was complete, and, you know, and then after he finished the taxes, he said, you know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put your lips together and blow. I guess. He said he was an accountant, but he had a big hat. He had one of those big hats, and he says, mama says stupid is as stupid does. So I figured I was in the right hands. I believe so. I mean, I asked him, I want the truth, are you certified, and he said, you can't handle the truth. So I just took his word for it. But the thing is, I'm just the guy behind the scenes, like he's the one doing the job. I mean, pay no attention to that man behind the curtain. That man behind the curtain is me, the tax filer, but he's the CPA, supposedly. He's the one that's supposed to take care of it. So I can focus my time on making sure that my image is kept up, because I wake up every morning, I say, magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all? And that's how I get through my steps of humanity and getting my things done. So I took his word for it. Really, you should be calling him. I'm not so worried about the arrest specifically. I mean, I do want to get the warrant off of my name, but they won't actually be able to arrest me. I actually live, like my residence is a hot air balloon. So if you tell the law enforcement, Rhodes, where we're going, we don't need Rhodes. You actually need a big drone, and then some handcuffs, and then someone to pilot it safely so it doesn't kill a big flock of pigs. So I'm not really sure what exactly needs to happen to get that taken off, at least get it off the record. But I would like to resolve this matter and get this figured out, because I'm having an old friend for dinner, and I don't have time for this. I'm sorry, you got to speak up. Hi, how's it going? What? No, no, I don't smoke. But because here's the thing. It's actually going to kill you. It might kill you faster than scamming people will. So maybe more often you need someone in your life to say, yippee-ki-yay, mother f***er. Stop scamming people, you son of a b***h. My precious, my precious, listen, my suggestion to you would be to embrace life, stop f***ing people over, get a better job, and actually be happy. Because I know for a fact that you're not. You making a lot of money? You making a lot of money stealing from people? You making a lot of money stealing from people? I grew up really poor, you know, like, without, like, raised by a single mom. I came to this beautiful country with $35 in my pocket, no speak English, no working permit, no friends. And I really think that you can change your life, no matter where you live, no matter where you came from, what your skin color, do you speak English or you don't. Well, best brother in the world, again, taking me to the airport. Right back at you. Thankfully it's not 4am this time. I have an 11 hour flight to Dublin, Ireland. Guinness is coming, Jameson is coming. I'm excited. You're gonna drink a lot.",
