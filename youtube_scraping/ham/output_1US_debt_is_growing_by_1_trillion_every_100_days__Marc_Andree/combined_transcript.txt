Speaker 2: We're adding a trillion dollars to the national debt every 100 days right now.
Speaker 1: And that's compounding and it's now passing the size of the Defense Department budget and it's compounding and it's pretty soon it's going to be adding a trillion dollars
Speaker 2: every 90 days and then it's going to be adding a trillion dollars every 80 days and then it's going to be a trillion dollars every 70 days. And then if this doesn't get fixed at some point we enter a hyperinflationary spiral and we become Argentina or Brazil and kablooey, right?
Speaker 1: And so like everybody in DC knows that something has to be done. And then everybody in DC knows for a fact that it's impossible to do anything, right?
Speaker 2: They know all the problems and they also know the sheer impossibility of fixing it. But I think what they're not taking into account that what the critics are not taking into account is these guys can do this in the full light of day and they can do it on social media.
Speaker 1: They can completely bypass the press. They can completely bypass the cynicism. They can expose any element of, you know, unconstitutional or, you know, silly government
Speaker 2: spending. They can run victory laps every single day on what they're doing.
Speaker 1: They can they can bring the people into the process. And again, if you think about it, this goes back to our Machiavellian structure, which
Speaker 2: is if you think about, again, you've got democracy, oligarchy, monarchy, rule of the many, rule
Speaker 1: of the few, rule of the one. You could think about what's happening here as a little bit of a sandwich, right?
Speaker 2: Which is you have, you have, we don't have a monarch, but we have a president rule of
Speaker 1: the one with some power. And then we have the people who can't organize, but they can be informed and they can be aware
Speaker 2: and they can express themselves through voting and polling, right? And so there's a sandwich happening right now is the way to think about it, which is
Speaker 1: you've got basically monarch monarchy, if you get rule of one combining with rule of many, right?
Speaker 2: And rule of many is that you get to vote, right? The people do get to vote basically.
Speaker 1: And then essentially Congress as in this sort of permanent bureaucratic class in Washington as the oligarchy in the middle. And so the White House plus the people, um, I think have the power to do all kinds of
Speaker 2: things here.
Speaker 1: And I, and I think that would, that would be the way I would watch it. The transparency. I mean, Elon just, uh, by who he is in is incentivized to be transparent and show the bullshit in the system and to celebrate the victories. So it's going to be so exciting. I mean, honestly, it just makes government more exciting, which is a win for everybody. These people are spending our money. These people have enormous contempt for the taxpayer. Okay.
Speaker 2: Here's the thing you're here in Washington. Here's one of the things. So the first thing you hear is this is impossible. They'll be able to do nothing. And then, yeah, I walked them through this and they're like, they start to get, it starts
Speaker 1: to dawn on them that this is a new kind of thing. And then they're like, well, it doesn't matter because all the money is in entitlements and
Speaker 2: the debt and the military. And so like, yeah, you've got like this silly fake, whatever, you know, NPR funding or whatever. And like, it just, it's a rounder and it doesn't matter. And you look it up in the budget and it's like, whatever, $500 million or $5 billion or it's the, or it's the, the, the, the, it's the charging stations that don't exist. It's the $40 billion of charging stations and they build eight charging stations or it's the, it's the broadband internet plan that delivered broadband to nobody. Right. And cost you $30 billion. Like, so these boondoggles and what everybody in Washington says is a $30 billion is a rounding error on the federal budget.
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter. Who cares if they, if they, if they make it go away.
Speaker 2: And of course, any taxpayer is like, what the, what do you mean it's $30 billion, right? And then, and then the experts are like, and then the press is in on this too. Then the experts are like, well, it doesn't, it doesn't matter because it's a rounding error. No, no, it's $30 billion.
Speaker 1: So if you're this cavalier about $30 billion, imagine how cavalier you are about the 3 trillion. Yeah. Okay.
Speaker 2: Then there's the, okay. $30 billion is $30 billion. A lot of the federal budget and percentage. No, it's not. But $30 billion divided by 30.
Speaker 1: We do the math $30 billion divided by let's say 300 million taxpayers, right? Like what's that math expert $100 per taxpayer per year. Okay.
Speaker 2: So $100 to an ordinary person working hard every day to make money and provide for their kids. $100 is a meal out. It's a trip to the amusement park. It's the ability to, you know, buy additional educational materials. It's the ability to have a babysitter, to be able to have a romantic relationship with your wife. It's, there's like a hundred things that that person can do with $100 that they're not doing because it's going to some bullshit program that is being basically where the money's being looted out in the form of just like ridiculous, ridiculousness and graft. And so the idea that that $30 billion program is not something that is like a very important
Speaker 1: thing to go after is just like the level of contempt for the taxpayer is just off the charts. And then that's just one of those programs. There's like a hundred of those programs and they're all just like that. Like it's not like any of this stuff is running well.
Speaker 2: Like the one thing we know is that none of this stuff is running well.
Speaker 1: Like we know that for sure. Right.
Speaker 2: And we like, we know these people aren't showing up to work and like, we know that all this crazy stuff is happening. Right.
Speaker 1: Um, and like, you know, the, the, the, do you remember Elon's story of the, um, do you remember Elon's story of what got the Amish to turn out to vote in Pennsylvania? Oh, okay.
Speaker 2: So Pennsylvania. Okay. So Pennsylvania is like a wonderful state. Great history.
Speaker 1: It has these cities like Philadelphia that have descended like other cities into just like complete chaos, violent madness and death. Right.
Speaker 2: And the federal government has just like let it happen in this incredibly violent places. And so the Biden administration decided that the big pressing law enforcement thing that they needed to do in Pennsylvania was that they needed to start raiding Amish farms to
Speaker 1: prevent them from selling raw milk with armed raids. Right. And it turns out it really pissed off the Amish and it turns out they weren't willing
Speaker 2: to drive to the polling places because they don't have cars, but if you came and got them, they would go and they would vote. And that's one of the reasons why Trump won.
Speaker 1: Anyway. So like the law enforcement agencies are off working on like crazy things.
Speaker 2: Like the system's not working.
Speaker 1: And so you, you add up, pick $130 billion programs. All right.
Speaker 2: Now you're okay.
Speaker 1: Math major. A hundred times a hundred.
Speaker 2: 10,000. $10,000.
Speaker 1: Okay. $10,000 per taxpayer per year. And, but it's also not just about money. That's really obviously money is a hugely important thing, but it's the cavalier attitude. Yes. That then in sort of in the ripple effect of that, it makes it so nobody wants to work in government and be productive. It makes it so the corruption can, it breeds corruption, it breeds laziness, it breeds secrecy because you don't want to be transparent about having done nothing all year, all this kind of stuff. And you don't want to reverse that. So it will be exciting for the future to work in government because the, the amazing thing, if you're the steel man government is you can do shit at scale. You have money and you can directly impact people's lives in a positive sense at scale. It's super exciting as long as there's no bureaucracy that slows you down or not huge amounts of bureaucracy that slows you down significantly. Yeah.
Speaker 2: So here's, here's the trick. This blew my mind because I was, you know, once you look into it, once you open the hell mouth of looking into the federal budget, you learn all kinds of things.
Speaker 1: So there is a term of art in government called impoundment. And so you, you, if you're like me, you've learned this the hard way when your car has
Speaker 2: been impounded. The government meaning of impoundment, the federal budget meaning is a different meaning.
Speaker 1: Impoundment is as follows. The constitution requires Congress to authorize money to be spent by the executive branch,
Speaker 2: right? So the, the executive branch goes to Congress, says we need money X, Congress does their
Speaker 1: thing and they come back and they say, you can have money Y. The money is appropriated from Congress.
Speaker 2: The executive branch spends it on the military or whatever they spend it on or on roads to nowhere or charging stations to nowhere or whatever.
Speaker 1: The, the, and what's in the constitution is the, the Congress appropriates the money. Over the last 60 years, um, there has been an additional interpretation of appropriations
Speaker 2: applied by the courts, um, and by the system, um, which is the executive branch not only needs Congress to appropriate X amount of money. The executive branch is not allowed to underspend.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I'm aware of this. I'm aware of this. And so there's this thing that happens in Washington at the end of every fiscal year,
Speaker 2: which is September 30th. And it's the, it's the great budget flush and any remaining money that's in the system that they don't know how to productively spend. They deliberately spend it on productively to the tune of hundreds and hundreds of billions
Speaker 1: of dollars. A president that doesn't want to spend the money, can't not spend it. Yeah. Like, okay.
Speaker 2: A that's not what's in the constitution. Um, and there's actually quite a good Wikipedia page that goes through the, the great debate on this has played out in the legal world over the last 60 years. And like, basically if you look at this with anything resembling, I think an open mind,
Speaker 1: you're like, all right, this is not what the founders meant. Um, and then number two, again, we go back to this thing of contempt. Like can you imagine showing up and running the government like that and thinking that
Speaker 2: you're doing the right thing and not going home at night and thinking that you've sold
Speaker 1: your soul, right? Like, I, it's just like, I actually think you sort of had a really good point, which is it's even unfair to the people who have to execute this. Yeah.
Speaker 2: It makes them, it makes them bad people and they didn't, they didn't start out wanting to be bad people. And so there is stuff like this, like, yeah, everywhere, everywhere. And so we'll see how far these guys get.
Speaker 1: I'm, I am extremely encouraged what I've, what I've seen so far. It seems like a lot of people will try to slow them down, but yeah, I hope they get far.
Speaker 2:
