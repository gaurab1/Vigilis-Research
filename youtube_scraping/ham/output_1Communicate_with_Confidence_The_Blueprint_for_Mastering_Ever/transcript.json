  "transcript": "into a meeting, if you think about what you want to get out of it or how you want to be perceived, then that actually dictates how you're going to show up. It's like you can use this in absolutely any area of your life and I think most of us are just sort of going through the day and surviving and there's a completely different way to think about the way that you communicate. I 100% agree in that if you look at where you are in life from your romantic relationships to where you are at work, there is a large percentage of that that is solely based upon what you said to that person. That just meant there are thoughts that came from your brain that to your mouth that you spoke out loud that have influenced where you are. You said something to that person and they liked it and now they want to date you and they said something you liked and there it is. You met over coffee at you know the airport or where you are at work at that promotion that you want. You have ways of just simply using the power of your words to influence everything and it can change even if you said things in the past that you regret or things you wish you would have said better. You can change everything about your life by what you say next. Are there a couple steps that somebody could take to just walk themselves through the kind of person that they want to be through their words? Because I feel like there's this step Jefferson that we don't really take with intention of getting clear that I want to be this kind of person. And it's one thing to kind of use kind words. It's a whole other thing to have a reckoning with yourself where you say this is an area of my life that I want to take control of and I can take control of it. Are there particular questions that somebody could ask themselves that help them get to what their values might be in terms of how they want to change the way they communicate, what they want the world to think about them? Like I often think when I go into a meeting what do I want people to say when I leave? And it's a trick that I learned when I was a public defender working for legal aid which is what do I want the jury to say the second that they get out of this courtroom and they get into that meeting with one another? What do I want them to say? And I use that now before I go into a meeting. What do I want them to think about me? And then I align the way that I show up based on the impact that I want to create in that room. I love that. I do a very similar that's the what energy am I bringing to the room? If everybody's at a table and you walk in and you're coming in what do you want the feeling to be? Oh this person's here. What's that energy that you're bringing? Because every one of us has a different energy that affects the room that they're in. Is it oh no somebody's here or oh great somebody's here or is it the oh man somebody's here. Everyone's a little bit different. The biggest tool that somebody can use is ask the question to themselves and also to the person that loves them the most more than anybody. Who do my words say that I am? Who do my words say that I am? And that is a great question to ask yourself or you ask somebody else who do my words say that I am? Because often what you say doesn't match exactly with who you want to be. I would encourage somebody to ask a friend, a spouse, the way that I speak what kind of energy does that give? Does that give anxiety? Do I rush my words? Do I speak too fast? Do I speak too slow? How do you want to tweak the room to understand how you want to communicate with that next person? So I would encourage in terms of action steps it's the question that you need to answer of yourself of who do you want to be with your words and then what words are you going to use? I think what you have to say is awesome of think long term of just kind of call your shot. I want to leave that room feeling like I am somebody who's confident. Right I think it's such an important point because you do have so much power over your reputation. You do have power over the impact that you make with other people and taking a beat before you walk in the room or you walk in the meeting or you walk into the party or you walk up to the sidelines at your kid's soccer game to really remind yourself what kind of person do I want to be and now let me align what I say and the energy that I bring to represent that. That's the crazy part about it. It's also the most simple part about it and that is it is simply within your control. When you walk away from an interaction from somebody and you go I really like that person. What was it? What was it that you liked? They said something nice about me. They smiled. They didn't criticize other people. It all has to do with your communication. Their experience of you is going to be almost entirely the words that you use right in front of them. And how they made that person feel. How you made that person feel right then and there. Love this. What are your best tips to be more effective at communicating at work? Tip number one would be have something to learn not something to prove. So anytime you're in an argument and it's not just work it's really anything. When you're in a conversation with somebody have something to learn from them rather than something to prove. Even if you want to prove yourself. I want to prove who I am. That doesn't come from you pushing your own agenda. It comes from you being curious about other people. And so if you want to be known as somebody who's respectful in the workplace or somebody who's kind you use kind words. If you want to know if somebody's respectful you use respectful words. So that means if you talk about somebody and gossip and do something negative that's what people are going to associate you with. Because it goes even wider than that. Then if other people associate with you that bad person well then you people are going to think differently about them. So it's these circles of communication of what you said oh you're a friend of so-and-so you friends of so-and-so that are going to influence that. If you want to be more respected at work use words that show more authority. You can use words like direction. I'd like to set the direction of this conversation. I don't like the direction of where this is going. All of a sudden it sounds like you're captain of the ship. You're just using the word direction. So you find ways that can influence who you want to be for good. What's one change somebody can make starting today to communicate more effectively with their family? When you need to have this hard conversation at all times show them that you love them that you care and you do that with the words. Meaning you tell them that I'm telling you this because I love you. Often I know people and you know people that they had really hard childhoods and they just never heard that from a parent that I'm proud of you that I love you. So you find ways to inject that into the conversation. I'm talking to you right now because I want us to learn from this conversation or I'm learning too. When you're having that you need to de-escalate an argument with a spouse or a kid. Hey I'm learning too. This is my first time to be a parent. This is your first time to be a kid. I'm learning too. Don't be afraid to apologize. Don't be afraid to own that. I think from a position of strength you can really really own that apology when you need to. I'm stealing that. I often say I'm doing the best I can but I like I'm learning too. Yeah. That's a beautiful thing. It's good for spouses too. I mean you can be dating forever but as soon as you get married and live together I mean it's it's a whole new world. It is. I just recently heard somebody say that second marriages are amazing particularly if it's with the same person and this idea that any moment you can change a relationship because you can change yourself and how you communicate. And that's the only thing you can't control. I can't control the other person. You can only control how you respond to it. I am going to steal everything that you just taught me and I'm so excited that you get to listen and be here and learn from Jefferson too. We're going to be leaving here going direction, kindness. I got to tell you this. What are your parting words? To anybody who's listening my parting words to you are this. You have a power that you haven't tapped into yet and that is just the power of your words. If you want to be seen as somebody who's strong you use stronger words. You want to be somebody who has seemed to be more decisive. Somebody who stands up for themselves. It is not a course you have to take. It is not a book you have to read. It is simply how you need to change the next word that comes out of your mouth. It is something that can be learned at any point. It doesn't matter how young you are to how old you are. What you say next has the power to change anything and if you use it for good and you use it for light you're always going to go right. Oh my god Jefferson. I didn't mean for that to rhyme but. I love, I like love you. I know that sounds like creepy but you are a huge light. Thank you. Thank you and my parting words to you. I hope you take absolutely everything that Jefferson just shared with us and you use it. You use it to create better relationships. To speak with authority. To have your words reflect the kind of person that you really want to be and in case no one else tells you this I wanted to be sure to tell you. I love you and I believe in you and I believe in your ability to create a better life and as Jefferson just taught you it's all in the power of your words. You get to say how cool is that.
