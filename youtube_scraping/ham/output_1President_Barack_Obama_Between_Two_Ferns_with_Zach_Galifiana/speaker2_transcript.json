  "transcript": "I have to get my great aunt some d- You know what, Zach? I have to say, when I heard that people actually watch this show, I was actually- Barack Obama. Barack Obama. Good to be with you, Zach. First of all, in 2013, you partied in a turkey. What do you have planned for 2014? We'll probably pardon another turkey. We do that every Thanksgiving. Was that depressing to you, seeing one turkey kind of taken out of circulation, a turkey you couldn't eat? Would you send Ambassador Rodman to North Korea on your behalf? I read somewhere that you'd be sending him to Syria. Or is that more of a job for Tonya Harding? Zach, he's not our ambassador. What should we do about North Ikea? Why don't we move on? What is it like to be the last president? Seriously, what's it like for this to be the last time you ever talk to a president? You don't think, though, that you can't run a third time, you know? No, actually, I think it's a good idea. You know, if I ran a third time, it'd be sort of like doing a third Hangover movie. Didn't really work out very well, did it? Now, I have to say that I've seen this show before, and some of the episodes have probably been a little bit better than this. For example, the one with Bradley Cooper, that was a great movie. Bradley Cooper, everybody loves him. He kind of carried that movie, didn't he? Those Hangover movies, basically he carried them. Yeah, everybody loves Bradley. Good for him. Good-looking guy. Being like that in Hollywood, that's easy. Tall, handsome, that's easy. Be short, fat, and smell like Doritos and try to make it to Hollywood. Is it going to be hard in two years when you're no longer president and people will stop letting you win at basketball? How does it feel having a three-inch? A three-inch horizontal. Where are you planning on building your presidential library, in Hawaii or your home country of Kenya? Both places seem like they would be… Zach, that's a ridiculous question. Where's your birth certificate? Why don't you show it to us right now? I don't want to show anybody my birth certificate. It's embarrassing. What's embarrassing about it? My weight. You know what I would do if I were president, Mr. President? I would make same-sex divorce. Why you're not president. You would not let him play football. What makes you think that he would want to play football? What if he was a nerd? Do you think a woman like Michelle would marry a nerd? Why don't you ask her whether she thinks I'm a nerd? No, I'm not going to let her near you. .coms or .nets or do you… No, actually we go to .govs. Have you heard of healthcare.gov? Health… By the way, what did you come here to… Well, first of all, I think it's fair to say that I wouldn't be with you here today if I didn't have something to plug. Have you heard of the Affordable Care Act? Oh, yeah, I heard about that. That's the thing that doesn't work. Why don't you get the guy that created the Zune to make your website? Healthcare.gov works great now. And millions of Americans have already gotten health insurance plans. And what we want is for people to know that you can get affordable healthcare. And most young Americans right now, they're not covered. And the truth is that they can get coverage all for what it costs you to pay your cell phone bill. Is this what they mean by drones? The point is that a lot of young people, they think they're invincible. No, no, not invisible. Invincible. Meaning that they don't think they can get hurt. I understand that. If they get that health insurance, it can really make a big difference. And they've got until March 31st to sign up. You can call 1-800-318-2596. First of all, Zach, nobody's interested in your texts. But second of all, you can do it in person. And the law means that insurers can't discriminate against you if you've got a pre-existing condition anymore. Yeah, but what about... How long have you had that? I'll tell you. Zach, you need to get that checked right away. You need to get on healthcare.gov because... That's one of the most disgusting things I've ever seen. Is your plug finally over? I suppose so. So which country were you rooting for in the Winter Olympics? Seriously? The President of the United States. What do you think, Zach? President Obama for being on the show? I'm going to press this. Don't touch that, please. I'm going to press this. I heard the interview and... You've been shooting these shows here in the diplomatic room? Who gave you permission to do that? Seriously? Who gave him clearance? That's the other hand. No, it's everywhere.",
